{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"1apac0a","Title":"My YouTube stalker","Author":"Unknown","Timestamp":1707770378000,"Text":"Hello, this is my first post and this is the reason why I created a Reddit account  \nI\u2019m a small YouTuber that rare uploads random content, like jokes, memes, or a mini vlogs of 20 second. I have 250 subscribers.  \nThe thing is that I follow a guy in Spain, he give teen fashion advice. The Spanish YouTuber made a video about give about to his brother\u2019s clothing. Well this profile called \u201cnova\u201d made a comment saying: \u201cYou have talen, you just need to know what you are good at\u201d. I replied saying: \u201cThat wasn\u2019t funny\u201d. He replied: \u201cthis guy is a baby, he just wants to cry\u201d. I don\u2019t really care about what people say about me, so I didn\u2019t reply. Later I found out that other 2 persons say the same thing as me. And \u201cnova\u201d just insulted them, saying that they are dumb and don\u2019t have a brain.  \nLike I said earlier I upload random content like \u201cmini vlogs\u201d in a video I made 2 months, I told a story of how I gain 20 dollars in a funny way. \u201cNova\u201d in MY VIDEO called me b\\*tch and told me I was fat. (To make something clear when I was 11 I was fat, but when I was 14 I started to lose weight, I\u2019m still A little overweight but the weight loss was enough so that the belly was not so noticeable. But there are times when those comments bring me traumas). I deleted those comments of my channels. I tried to \u201cblock\u201c home but there is just a \u201chide\u201d Button in his channel.  \nLater the Spanish YouTuber uploaded a video days later using a \u201cIce Spice\u201d song. I ONLY put the name of the song in the comment. Just that. And \u201cnova\u201d replied to my comment saying I was his \u201cpet\u201d and he is the \u201cking\u201d. I ignored him thinking he will gave up. It didn\u2019t.  \n9 days ago the Spanish YouTuber made a video talking about the \u201cskinny jeans\u201d I made a comment saying \u201cAnd that\u2019s the reason why I don\u2019t wear jeans at all\u201d and \u201cNova\u201d replied: \u201cobviously they are going to squeeze you if with 2 more sizes you are already morbidly obese\u201d 3 days later The Spanish YouTuber made a video of 10 dollars clothing. I made a joke saying: \u201cIn the Guayaquil bay in Ecuador you can buy shoes \u201cMike\u201d (Nike fake shoes) with just 8 dollars\u201d. So \u201cnova\u201d replied with: \u201cso Ecuador now use money, great advance ball of (monkey and orangutan emojis)\u201d.  \nMy last comment was about his last video when \u201cThe Spanish YouTuber\u201d made a video telling her mom what to wear. He told her mom to use baggy pants, while she was wearing blue jeans. This was the only comment I made about saying that his advice was bad saying: \u201cNo offense but your mom looks better with the jeans\u201d. And \u201cNova\u201d replied saying: \u201cAt least you use your brain\u201d that comment pissed me off because this creep has been finding my comments just to insult me or bully me. I replied saying: \u201cI don\u2019t care about you say\u201d . He replied: \u201cyou cared enough to answer me\u201d.  \nI\u2019m tired of him. I doubt he can do any physical damage to me because obviously \u201dNova\u201d is in Spain but my YouTube channel say I\u2019m in Ecuador. But truly I\u2019m in the US.

She lied to me, she used intermittent reinforcement and lovebombed me, and she always made me feel like I was going insane. She stuck me in a very strong trauma bond, and had used the fact that I was to abuse me more.\nShe had started spreading the rumor that I was apparently harassing her, because of how often she would abuse me for these little things, and all I had ever shown her at that point was praise and positivity.\nLater that year, I was still stuck in that trauma bond. It took me a long time to break out of it. I was trying to tell people what was really going on with me and the abuser, but all her enablers always gaslit and shamed me for even speaking up. They kept telling me that I was a bad person for daring to speak about what happened, because my abuser had already lied to them.\nEvery single time I tried to speak up, the abuse would escalate and the trauma bond got stronger. The second time I tried to expose her(bad idea if you're dealing with a narc), she accused me of stalking and doxing her. She started to convince people that I was, and even deleted her age(which before was public on her Twitter page), and made both of her Instagram pages(which were also public before)private, and claimed another alias of hers as her \"real name\" just to make the rumor believable. It was one of the most heinous and most despicable things I had ever witnessed. A lot of people now see me as a criminal, and as obsessed creepy stalker, irredeemable, an entitled person, all because I was trying to speak up about what had really happened.\nThe smear campaign ruined my online life. I had a friendship destroyed because my abuser had decided to cry victim and smear me to my ex, and she became one of my abusers enablers.\nAny point beyond that, whenever I tried to speak up about what happened, I was dismissed and the smear campaign escalated.\n\nI left that fandom over a year ago.\nIt was only an acquaintanceship, but that doesn't make it hurt any less, nor does it minimize the trauma I have from it.\n\nBecause I had tried to speak up about what was really happening, in my abusers' and their apologists' eyes, I am a harasser, doxer, liar, manipulative, obsessed stalker, can't take criticism, childish, loser, and an evil person.\n\nI'm still trying to figure out how I can get around the Internet and pursue my dreams and passions and live my life without the constant threat of it all being taken away because of my abusers. I've tried to set healthy boundaries for myself, but I'm still scared of being scrutinized and constantly judged by other strangers because of my abusers.","Score":4,"Total_comments":8}

I realize now, how can I be loving and wanting to be a genuine friend if I am bitter and angry at rejection? We are not entitled to anyone's friendship. Maybe you two got off on the wrong foot, and you didn't act the way she expected a friendly person to act. She got weirded out and painted you in a bad light. I'm sorry that she didn't get to know the real you. I think the pain comes from being misunderstood, that if she just gave you a chance she could see what a good person you are. Your only choice is to move forward, and realize most of it is not your fault. You were insecure. Seeing someone as an idol is a form of insecurity, and puts yourself beneath her. Friends are supposed to be equals. The only part you played was continuing to be nice to her and hoping to win her approval, next time, don't give her that power.\u00a0\n\n\nActually I am writing a book about this topic, because I was similarly harassed years ago and it made me want to give up on my dreams.

She probably went through something stressful, and doesn't have the emotional regulation skills or awareness to deal with it, so she was counting on her friends to lift her up and reduce her stress. You might have been a little absent or distracted on that day she needed you most. Her higher than normal stress plus your absence makes her think you abandoned her, and thus fake. She couldn't communicate with you about why she feels that way. All she can do is blame you.\u00a0\n\n\nContinued acts of threats to get your attention are her attempts at reducing stress. Now on top of whatever the original stressor was, she has new stress of feeling ignored and unseen.

Alternatively, if you really love her, you can ask her what's wrong and be as loving, safe, and reassuring as possible. Behaviors like calling the police and criticizing her behavior adds stress and escalates the behavior. She seems to be having some anxious attachment type of disregulation attack.

They're like petulant children escalating their behavior to get a reaction. Don't stoop to their level. In their mind, they see you as above them, that's why it's okay to hit you metaphorically speaking. If you were beneath them, they'd pity you and try to help you instead. Bullies hate that your brilliance shines a light on their ugliness. Bullies WANT drama. They can't be beautiful, or talented, or whatever else, so all they can do is try to ruin your peace of mind.\u00a0\n\n\nI think social media platforms know Bullies will not give up. If you respond to them, Bullies will escalate. So that's why social media has to nip it in the bud. It sucks as the content creator that you can't defend yourself, but you don't need to. If you defend yourself, that's stooping to their level and admitting your beauty is up for question and their opinion matters. Which they don't matter. And secondly, you have already won. Their bullying is actually proof that you are beautiful. You're so beautiful you make them insecure. You don't need to defend yourself about that.

BUT PLEASE, DO NOT FEEL ATTACKED PERSONALLY. DON'T HATE. JUST IGNORE OR BLOCK ME.***\n\nHi,  \nI'm  just somebody that wants to pass a message... and that wants to stay anonymous. Let's just call me ''Flower''. I, Flower, currently living under a preasuring fear of internet, wants to say something... My message is about the internet. Internet being hateful, internet being unsafe. I know that it could be seen as dumb, the fact that I want my message about the ''unsafe internet'' ON INTERNET, and I know you could think ''well, how did you not know that internet was so unsafe?'', but it's the only way I can spread my message quickly. **Please, if you are not interested on listening to me, ignore this message completely.**   \nStop spreading hate on internet. I don't get it no more. Many associations, many organisations, many cyber security campaign have been telling... actually, ANNOYING the world about cyberbullying, harrassment on internet and illegal actions on internet. Nobody listens, because they think it's too... dumb. Yeah, I'm saying it vulgarly. People think it's dumb. Listening to professionals, helping us. People also think it's dumb to listen to people that wants to prevent harrassment and bullying. In real life as much as online. Then, I'm not a professional, but I'm a voice among many others... calling for help.\n\nI know that plugging proofs are websites aren't necessary, but I still made some researches. So I apologize in advance. On the website: [https:\/\/jaapl.org\/](https:\/\/jaapl.org\/) , they are stating; ''The incidences of both cyberbullying and adolescent suicide are rising in the United States, with recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showing that 14.9 percent of adolescents have been cyberbullied and 13.6 percent of adolescents have made a serious suicide attempt.'' Why 13.6% ? It should be 0%. Nobody deserves to die because of the preasure of some bad comments you thought was just... a dumb thing that would go away. Hidding behind a username, behind many of accounts or fake accounts of yours is a thing... because you think might think something like : ''Oh they don't know me. They will never know who I am''. Fine. Ok. But for some people, even if they don't know you, that you are just a stranger, that you are literally nobody for them, it hurts them. Maybe they are going through something that you have no idea about what they are going through. Oh no wait... you don't care. It doesn't matter to you. Because they are also nobody for you. Because in your mind, you think it'll go away that easily. Because you think ''Why would they take it seriously?'', ''Like... I'm just telling the truth. It's not that big of a deal?''. Well yes, it can be that big of a deal. Violently, you could be the cause of someone's... end. You would like that? To have someone's death on your conscience? If so, why so heartless? Why would hurting people to an irrecoverable level would be fun? You have or could have blood on your hands. A crime.  \n...no? It doesn't bother you? Ok.\n\nAnother subjects that frightens me: doxxing, hacking, stalking, every illegal cyber actions under someone's informations or life. Why does that exist? Ruining someone's life on internet. Because yes, sharing someone's personnal informations is ruining someone's life. Some people reacts ''What are they gonna do with my informations anyways?''. It doesn't matter to you what could happen. I heared that people get their bank informations, social security number, ID, phone number, your email or other stolen informations public. Mostly from doxxing. For what? We don't want to know, but we have to know some consequences. Because ignorance is very present. People like to harrass others. Prank people thinking it's funny. Wasting someone's time and patience for their reactions. It's so funny seeing someone crying. Being so angry. Reacting to the mockeries. Oh... wasn't I talking about suicide earlier? Yes, it can push someone to acts. Again? More blood on your hands?\n\n**I won't be the one telling you it's bad or illegal.** Everyone knows it is. As you could state ''Who is too dumb to not know it's illegal?''. Not you. Not me. Someone else wouldn't be aware about it. We don't know who. But it doesn't make someone stupid to learn something important. It doesn't make someone stupid for learning something that could make them responsible of a crime.\n\nDon't listen to me if you don't want my opinion. It's ok. But I still want to share it in case it could interest someone that cares. I'm scared myself of all of this. I've experienced a lot. I rather not sharing it, because it does not matter to anyone. Nobody cares. But I just want all of these forms of illegal and violent acts to stop. Hmm.... No. Actually. I can't stop this. It's impossible. It doesn't work that way, no. Basically, I'm not expecting to change the world after this message. I just hope that there is people out there that can relate to my words. I just hope someday, all the hate in the world can stop. Why can't we just all feel safe? Why can't we have peace? On internet as much as in the real world. Even your worst enemies, you can despise them as much as you want... but please. Don't. Make. Any. Actions. You could regret it one day... well, only if you care. Only if you decided to care. Only if you realized that your actions can ruin someone's life. Push someone to death. It's a crime. I'll repeat it as much as you want. **IT'S.A.CRIME**. So it do not just ruins someone else's life, it also can ruin yours. Yeah, ok, you can never be caught at all during your lifetime. But I don't see why sully your name is good. In the world of internet, maybe ruining an innocent's life is some kind of enhancement to your profile... but in the real world it's not. Oh? Ok. You don't care.\n\nI don't get it. All types of cyber protection online... costs money? Why??? Paying for my security? Ok. That's lux now. Of course, every types of business needs money out of this. Including online protection. But I think it should be already programmed in our devices. Meh, who am I to say this after all? Definitely not someone that has an online business.\n\nTo conclude this long message, that probably made either a difference or nothing at all. I just want to thank the people that are listening to me. I just want us to be safe. Me. You. Everybody. I just want that cyber violence to stop. Yes, I dare call it violence. If you don't agree, it's fine. It's just my opinion after all. You don't have to agree with me. That's it. \n\n....ugh. just gonna take the risk to post that.","Score":3,"Total_comments":1}

So much love that they wouldn't care and wouldn't believe what a stranger says. The fact that the kid is young and manipulable enough to believe they are bad because of someone's opinion, means it would be so much easier to teach the kid they are loved and supported instead of tracking down some creepy stranger to kick his ass.\u00a0\n\n\nI saw a research paper that says victims of bullies are children of neglectful parents. Secure children don't get bullied because they laugh off and don't care about what creepy weirdos say. I'm not blaming you as the parent, a foster kid is going to have lots of attachment issues. Which means they need extra love and security. Do whatever you can to show that kid love. If they're being bullied about their art, praise their art. If they're being bullied about their looks, take them on a shopping spree and makeover. Show them they're valuable and loved.\u00a0\n\n\nThere are services online that can block instagram accounts and any subsequent accounts they make. Report to Instagram too. I suspect the \"creepy\" guy is actually a girl, because girls are more into social manipulation and clinginess. Most guys don't have the energy to stalk obsessively. That creep is probably also a troubled child too, but more importantly, love your foster child and show their value and worth and that life is full of joy and worth living. As someone who was passed around as a kid, I feel for the foster kid, and it's no wonder it can be easy to become a target of bullying if you aren't secure.\u00a0","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

They were friends at first, for about 8 months, then they dated for about a month. They had broken up, about a month ago. At first, he tried to reconsile their relationship, and then their friendship, but after about 2 weeks, she said \"stop contacting me\" but for about a week, she would still contact him, but if he tried to contact her, she would still insist that he stop. After that, he would still continue to text her, then got blocked, and then downloaded a texting app to get in contact with her one last time. Today, a police officer had contacted him, saying that he needed to leave said girl alone, and that he was having charges filed against him for cyberstalking and cyberharrassing. The girl is also claiming he also was stalking her at work, even though he was banned from the bar after quitting, and was only in the vicinity to visit a friend across the street at a seperate bar, because he is leaving the state soon, and wanted to say goodbye one last time.When he tried to look up the case number online, he couldnt find anything, but he went to the local police station, and they found the case in their system. He never once sent anything malicious, he never threatened her, or sent anything \"lewd\", he only tried to reconsile their relationship. Our question is, what would be the steps that he should take? What can he expect? Do you think he needs an actual lawyer, or a public defender? What are the minimum penalties of this matter, as I personally dont belive he will recieve the maximum penalties of a year in jail and a 1000 dollar fine. The state is Florida BTW, Volusia County.","Score":2,"Total_comments":1}

We were instantly friends and close. \n\nMy situation is particularly hard, I have a cerebral palsy which means I'm in a wheelchair since my childhood (and for life, but I'm ok with this). My family was a disaster at that time. I was placed in a family foster home where the \"parents\" and I had been arguing a lot. They often threatened me to quick me out and so on.\n\nAt that time, I did not have any friend except X. They were the first person to invite me at their house and at their birthday party, ever. \n\nDuring the second year of high school, I had to be hospitalized because I had to have a chirurgical procedure on my knees and foot. Even in that situation, we lived a long distance friendship and everything went well.\n\nEverything changed in the last year of high school.\n\nAt that time, I was living a bad depression episode and with gender dysphoria. I also had to move in with my family where my abuser still lived. I couldn't be ok at all and X tried to help me.\n\nI also met my first bf online and he helped me too.\n\nThey met each other during October this year when my mom didn't want to drive me at his hotel and I had to \"send\" X there so my bf wouldn't get bored. They have fun and became friends.\n\nI developed my relationship with my bf alongside my friendship with X. Everything went great unlikely my mental health and family's mood.\n\nAfter the New Year Eve we all spent together, I had to make the decision to leave my family and my foster home because I couldn't take it anymore.\n\nX sheltered me with their mom. (I will always feel thanks full for this).\n\nAt the beginning, everything went great despite my depression was still here. In fact I could barely help and I usually lied down on the floor. I did the dishes sometimes tho. \n\nX helped me to get infos about depression, and trauma response and PTSD. I have all of that. I was dissociating a lot (I in fact have DID).\n\nThen, all my relationships fell apart and everything went wrong.\n\nI started to have feeling for X despite my relationship with my bf. I talked to them both. X told me they didn't love me  and it was hard but ok.\n\nIn may a classmate told me she had a crush on them. And I told this girl that they had a crush on someone else so, they will probably not be interesting in a relationship.\n\nI text that girl later after I realized I have told their secret \"don't tell X, they're gonna kill me\".\n\nThe morning after, during a little wake up I had while turning on the other side. I saw them on my phone, gossip with their sister. I didn't realize it was my phone and I get back to sleep.\n\nWhen I definitely wake-up, they both (X & sister) said they have to talk to me after my breakfast.\n\nWe get in a park and the sister told me smthg like \"Who the fuck do you think you are to do that ? You are NO ONE.\"\n\nIn fact they had unlock my phone while I was sleeping, without my consent.\n\nI remembered come back to their home completely devastated, crying like never and heartbroken.\n\nI still had to live with them because I had nowhere to go. \n\nThe situation was deteriorated even more after.\n\nThey send me email about how they were in pain because of my selfish behavior, while I will take my shower.\n\nThen, they started to write about me on Wattpad. They used terms like \"narcissistic, selfish, toxic\" and so on.\n\nI was devastated. I had suicidal thoughts.\n\nThen they told me to go kill myself. It was the worst.\n\nThen their mom dumped me in an another foster home (we don't care about that). My bf dumped me for one of his fried he cheated me with (X knew it and never told). I had no opportunity to go to university.\n\nEventually I got back on my wheels to live a normal life.\n\nOfc I often tweet about them on private account because they are a huge source of trauma and I have PTSD about this. And also on Wattpad but nothing mean, I just missed them a lot.\n\n3 years later, they made a complain about me to the cops. In fact, they had an acces to my private account (without me knowing). My ex bf in fact send them anything I would write. And at that time I wanted to go to uni on line, applying to the same structure. They may have been scared but I didn't think anything bad.\n\nThey had reuploaded everything they posted on Wattpad about me and long story short, their mom threatened to slap me and called me crazy.\n\nI was in a big mental health crisis.\n\nI managed to tell the cops I was sorry and needed help, I was not going to hurt them (this is still very true).\n\nI know they continue to stalk me and so but I let it go.\n\nLike I said, I developed severe PTSD due to that situation. I have nightmares once a week, I have burst of anxiety, I'm SCARED to see them \/ their family\/ their friends, I didn't apply to uni.\n\nRecently I was on Tumblr and saw a post about me. AGAIN. I'm devastating. It was originally an analysis about Crowley and Aziraphale and Az trauma response. \n\nAnd (without my name) they mentioned my story with my family and concluded \"he wanted to get back to his family and became a manipulator \/ toxic\" (not in these exact words).\n\nThis post had made 182 likes and it's in their pinned post.\n\nIt's not the first time and I'm so tired of this. I have a mental health crisis right now bc of it.\n\nI can't take it anymore.\n\nDo you have any advice for me ?\n\nI tried to call the cops but they didn't take my case.

I\u2019m reeling from a cyberbullying experience so bad that even a car repossession agent was like, on my side, when she spoke to me by phone yesterday. That means both the repossession agent and the bank that lent me my car are quietly rooting for me and on my side to recover from the cyberbullying. They agree that I\u2019m relatively close to succeeding, which is one of the biggest acts of affirmation and confidence I have right now. While writing a cover letter in French for a job application in France, I started to freeze up and suffer from another wave of residual cyberbullying  trauma. I\u2019m currently brainstorming on how to work through it, if I can.

In fact you kind of opened my eyes a lot. Most people who have financial suffering from cyberbullying do so because they lose their job (I bet). My case is a little different, but I basically had a financial disaster on the scale of several thousand dollars because of the bullying, spent much of this year homeless, and am technically still homeless, unless you consider scraping together funds for month to month AirBNBs, across multiple different states, to be a state of being housed. Depends on how you define your terms. I consider myself a homeless person who is grossed out my homeless shelters but is definitely homeless if you look like what it feels like when I try to do work at a job, at school, or even what it takes sometimes to look presentable for a job interview.\n\nI'm still a little too traumatized to say very much, and I've already said enough that if the cyberbullies (it happened here on Reddit) find this, some of them would just go to town. \n\nWhy am I not calling it theft\/fraud -- good question. Because i am in love with one of the cyberbullies' friends. I would not consider him a cyberbully but some of my friends consider him both a cyberbully and a fraudster. I love him, and it would probably take me months or years of therapy to get to the point where I would call him himself a cyberbully. Or a fraudster. \n\nPolice have been involved, on both sides, I think--although my experience of the police was being involuntarily hospitalized when I had a breakdown from the cyberbullying, and also calling the police to try to break up domestic violence, which is something a therapist told me to do if I consider myself to be a good friend to him. \n\nIt's a very messy story. I lost both of my checking accounts because of all this. I'm on a probationary credit union account and I'll become eligible to apply for a full upgrade to a normal account with that credit union around Nov 20. Although I think I may still get my application rejected until I clean up my debts to Wells Fargo and Chase that accrued during\/ as a result of he cyber bullying. But Nov 20 is when I become eligible to apply.\n\nYour comments really did open my eyes. I bet if I read about cyberbullying and real-life\/ offline consequences, on Google, I would find a lot of theoretical context that would help me. Like, half the people who post on here are middle and high schoolers, right? -- but for the half who are adults, this can be what cyberbullying results in. Losing a job or other adverse financial consequences and more.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

Even when I got scammed of $20,000 last year, from a fraudulent Craigslist real estate posting, the case went up to the FBI, but the FBI didn't do anything and no charges were filed -- because the FBI handles cases like these by collecting them together in to a bucket of cases until the total value of the bucket passes some threshold -- say, $200,000, or $500,000 -- and my bucket never reached that. The case died in bureaucracy land.\n\nI found justice in hiring a good accountant who marked the loss as a business expense on my tax return, which worked because I am self-employed (or was). I'm considering starting a W2 job again later this month. I really do prefer self-employment because my life has constant crises like these and you can really deduct an appropriate portion of them as business expenses related to the proportional size your home office\/ working space takes up in your home. So like for the $20k Craigslist scam, I wasn't able to get credit for the whole thing, but estimating that I work on my laptop from my bedroom or living room, and the room takes up about 1\/3 or 1\/4 of the space in the apartment, my accountant was able to qualify a good $8,000 or so from the $20,000 loss toward lowering my tax burden\/ taxable income for the year.\n\nI think I did actually file a police report about the cyberbullying at one point. Police are not a magic wand, unfortunately. They're more of a bureaucracy than we realize -- just like even the FBI was, in my case. I hope you never have to learn that the hard way, like I hope you never have the police let you down when you need them.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

(My public defender told the prosecutor I had JUST gone through a stillbirth literally days before this courtdate and they felt awful and even stated that this woman was unstable) Obviously upset, I posted about my situation online and that was my mistake, because of that, she has taken upon herself to harass my family by calling cps and cops on us multiple times a year, TWICE just this month, because she knows my birthday is coming up I think. She would call physical workplaces to the point of physical uncomfortably in the workplace at 4 different locations. Rue 21, Doordash, my husband's old workplace Jacksons gas station, even SCENTSY. A little MLM I tried for a minute because she wouldn't stop calling where ever I tried to work. To this day I'm scared to work anywhere outside of my home because she will sabotage it and harass the business by calling or leaving negative reviews. so I've resorted to NSFW type stuff. \"OF and content creation\" since I've started this, she sabotages and steals naked photos of me and posts them in random places under my posts to try and ruin my ads. She messages my followers and asks them to delete their nice comments on my posts or downvote my posts. She comments mean things on fake accounts. She watched how I used Reddit and joined the same subreddits I did and started posting in them directly after I did even within an HOUR of posting in them. I had to change my phone number after that court date because she signed my phone number up for so many spam calls that my phone wasn't even USABLE. 3 months ago my Dad passed away and she threatened me off a fake account to stay on my toes because she was going to be at his funeral and named the location and time. Last night a sincere, poor cop knocked on my door and said that I've been harassing her and that he was asked by her to come talk to us about it and of course. I was about to get my newborn to sleep when this happened so he could obviously see we weren't out harassing anyone. And before anyone says oh you have more than enough evidence, press charges, blah blah blah, I KNOW. The cop said that there was a ton in the system, I have BUCKETS of evidence. And. Nothing. They won't do anything about crap. I've tried since the very beginning and they always say oh there's not enough evidence. It's truly contradicting and I feel like this is the only way I have to vent. I did include a weird Twitter rant from her about me that she supposedly had posted last night directly after calling the police on me and my kids at 11 pm for harassing her \ud83e\udd21 just to intrigue interest I guess because I feel like no one really cares to do the actual research. They just believe the cyber bully who has a literal record (earlier this year an article was posted about her hurting one of her kids and she got arrested for felony injury to a child but it was dropped down to disturbing the peace) yeah none of it makes any sense chronologically but \ud83d\ude48 there has been SO MUCH \ud83e\udd0c its crazy to think that at any minor inconvenience in this woman's life, I have to worry about unsolicited revenge coming my way and I walk on eggshells everyday not only in real life but in the cyber side of it too.\n\nIf you read all of this, thanks for your time!","Score":9,"Total_comments":2}

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"17b2jqo","Title":"Cyberbulling within Reddit","Author":"Cocainethecat","Timestamp":1697666174000,"Text":"So I recently posted some bags which according to you, are all fakes.  r\/fashion conveniently waited for a few days to remove offensive comments before removing the post.  THe moderator claims they are understaffed.  I am a strong woman and I can withstand a lot.  I am worried that a person who has a weaker personality, she simply strand no chance at the relentless cyberbullying.    r\/fashion is clearly reckless as to the well being of its members.  All it cares is to push for higher subscription and more products down consumer's throat (I don't know for sure but do you honestly believe all the bag reviews are done by \"genuine\" people? Of course, Reddit takes a kickback\/rebate\/commission whatever you like to call it.  \n\nAfter fake bags, I am also a fake attorney, and everything about me is fake.  You are all very happy to criticise me yet one thing which baffles me is you all turn your comment button off, refusing to let me leave you an answer. Then why not keep your mouth shout in the face place? What have you achieved? Leaving a public record that I said I only have budget to purchase a white and a black birkin and I suddenly purchased a Kelly birkin? Girl, I did not purchase a Kelly birkin.  I purchased a very unique farming picnic osier bag which is totally different from a Kelly birkin.  As to why do I have money.  Whilst you do not believe it, as a Partner of a UK headquartered law firm, October is my first distribution time.  Hence I have the money.  Can you please get your facts straight first before you pick a fight with me? One thing I find it really annoying is that if my opponent has not properly prepared.  It is wasting everyone's time.  \n\nI have been working non-stop 48 hours and I still have the energy to take each one of you on, one by one.   \n\nI have been subject to unrelenting abuses, because people think I am \"entitled\".   Two things happened today.  Two non Reddit person stood up for me. \n\nThe first non Reddit American person who stood up for me is Zeko, who is authenticating my Chanel bags which I did not purchase directly from Chanel's stores. This was after someone said my toes look ugly.  \n\nThen someone wrote in the chain below that he wishes me to die quickly.  When I told my client who is a general counsel of an asset management firm, he was shocked and apologised on behalf of his fellow countrymen. \n\nYou can see the attachment and the link below for a sample of the abuses which I have been subject to.  I do not purport to repeat that.  However, I am known as a person who you do not mess with and for your information, I won against a major opponent in June last year who attempted to mess with me.    \n\nI am not going to talk about my personality, whether I am entitled etc.  I am going to talk about why did two non Reddit American stood up for me, when a Reddit staff, who is supposed to be keeping members safe, is no where to be found.  In fact, r\/handbag's mod said I threaten them and I am therefore permanently kicked out of the group. \n\nThe only question I asked is whether a moderator should be held liable if it actively or turned a blind eye to defamatory materials being circulated and disseminated on its platform.   Her argument is that everyone should be entitled to their opinions.  Hang on. I believe there is an important distinction between facts and opinion.  As [stopbullying.gov](https:\/\/stopbullying.gov) has defined it, \"cyber bullying includes sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else\".  Applying to my case, every one said my bags are fake but Zeko's appearance confirmed she did verify my bags and if my bags were fake, why would she give me a helping hand when I need most? If r\/handbag does not remove words such as fake in the publication, is it not aiding and abetting cyber bullying (i.e. facilitating sending, posting, sharing of negative, harmful, false or mean content)? Instead of dealing whether you are aiding and abetting, you permanent shut me off from the group.  Fine. The other reason I got shut off is that I am an elitist.  So on one hand, it is perfectly fine for a lady to show off her Chanel selection with matching shoe but on the other hand, it is NOT find when Dior invites me to attend a pre-launch party for VIP tomorrow.  This is because according to r\/handbag's logic, the lady who shows off her Chanel bag is forming an opinion that her bags are nice but as to attending a VIP pre-launch party, no - because this is a fact.  \n\nYou may wonder why I consider this to be harmful and mean comment - I work very hard in order to get to where I am today.  Unlike a post which I find very funny where a woman keeps emphasising her real estate property dad and her private equity boyfriend (four times) gave her the Chanel, I work hard for every single one of the bag.  It is therefore very harmful and hurtful for you to say my bags are fake.   \nIt ridiculate the hard work which I have put in.   Also clearly, statements like \"I have never seen any bags stitch like that are false\".  I have Chanel, Hermes, Dior and Gucci.  Each period has different stitching techniques.  Do you really know all of the stitching techniques between different periods to make such a board statement? \n\nAs to the guy who told me to kill myself, I still can't figure out, will he say this to his colleagues at work in the face? Simply because you are hiding online anonymously mean you can tell people to die? \n\nMy final note today is people are upset because Chanel, Dior and Hermes all agree that I can let my cat in their shops,  I ask for permission in advance.  People who say I only buy fakes then suddenly say \"how much did I pre-spend for this privilege's\".  Come on, you can only pre-spend or use fake.  You cant be pre-spending and using fake as it simply does not make sense.  \n\nI would like to end at a note that I am really worried at whether a person who is mentally not as strong as me be able to withstand the relentless bullying.  It will be very sad to learn if he\/she has to take medication, following an episode of major cyber bullying.  This is a major red flag in Reddit's business model and it is really worrying and if I am asked to write a due diligence report or if I am asked to testify publicly, I will certainly not mince my word.    \n\nOh yes, one lady recommended I go and see a counsellor.  I recommend her to see a psychiatrist back.   People think they are clever but in fact, they are asked to be insulted.    \n\nhttps:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/TheHermesGame\/comments\/179w84x\/today\\_is\\_not\\_my\\_birthday\\_but\/","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I\u2019ve been through 2 cycles of parenting teenagers where I\u2019ve had to be the comforter, the protector, the voice of reason and all of the above more than once. The easiest answer to cyber bullying is to block the bully. Don\u2019t listen to them. Ignore them. Be the bigger person. All that jazz. But then all of a sudden, at this age, for the first time in my life, I\u2019m the target of someone\u2019s very deranged social media rantings. Rantings that have gone from annoying and a little embarrassing to scary and threatening. \n\nSurprised is an understatement for how I felt when HR called me in to make me aware of some posts that were being made about me on social media by a former employee. I knew the employee was disgruntled with the company and had seen\/heard of his rantings regarding his termination but I had not really been following lately. I wasn\u2019t his supervisor and didn\u2019t have much interaction with him but I am in management so I assume this is why I am a target. At first he just named me as someone he doesn\u2019t like. But then it got really personal. Making fun of my voice, my body. That made me feel embarrassed because at this point, the entire company is watching his social media. My colleagues, my leadership staff, my employees. But also my adult children, my husband and my siblings. Then it turned scary. I\u2019m not the only person he is targeting but I still feel very alone and isolated. I took a day off work when he started talking about office shootings. That\u2019s when we contacted authorities who as far as I know, have done nothing nor will they. \n\nI\u2019m not really sleeping much. I\u2019m checking his multiple social media accounts multiple times a day and night. Of course blocking him is a good idea but then I fear not knowing what he\u2019s doing. I\u2019ve become so obsessed with looking for my name, looking to see what he is saying now, it\u2019s completely consumed me. \n\nI feel sad. I feel scared. I feel violated. I feel humiliated. I know these are all the things he wants me to feel. My rational mind is saying, this is the reaction he wants. This is what he wants you to feel. He wants you to react. But my heart just wants to curl up in a ball and cry. \n\nI never imagined that I would experience this level of meanness. I am considering using my companies employee assistance program to get therapy. I feel like I\u2019m living in fear. I feel like I\u2019ve underestimated how scary and how isolating to be attacked in this way is. I almost would have rather a fist fight than to have all of this posted all over social media with my name and photos. If I ever change jobs, they will see all of this. It\u2019s not my fault but it will follow me as long as it\u2019s active. He is winning and he will win as long as he\u2019s able to keep posting. Nothing seems to slow him down. It\u2019s been weeks of constant all day long rantings. It\u2019s just never going to end.","Score":9,"Total_comments":9}

This is a complex trauma but a trauma nonetheless. It really takes a toll on you. \n\nAnyway, thank you again for sharing. I\u2019m so sorry this happening to you (and your family). Please know that you\u2019re not alone. If you ever want to chat privately, send me a message.\n\nI know it feels like it will never end \u2026 mine hasn\u2019t. But it has shifted over time and I\u2019ve grown in ways I may have not have without this experience. Would I do it again or wish it on anyone? Hell no.

There is a girl on the website my friends and I frequent that is fanning the flames and blaming us (Friends and me) for harassing her in the past and we have told her we are not the ones spamming her or her friends. \n\nYes, we were being rude to her by telling her to leave us alone and we're not the ones harassing her because we, frankly wanted to be left alone. Her identity was stolen in the past and that did not help things as they said cruel things to us and made us believe it was her for purely entertainment as they admitted to me months ago. So that did not help. \n\nAs of now, They are utterly convinced we are the spammers, we made a hatepage about ourselves and they are going further to believe that my friend cheated on her husband because a spammer told them that she went on cam in her undies for a guy. Now, that guy was supposedly a white hacker that my friend asked for help in trying to figure out who the spammers were so she could take legal action against. That plan failed and he made up those accusations against her.\n\nBut good god these people I feel are a special kind of stupid to seriously our lives revolve around spamming them. nine times out of ten I am nowhere near that website that I am getting spammed on and when I get spammed, I am either at work or asleep or gaming.

She used to outright bully me when we were kids but she seemingly got over it and we became friends in middle school. The whole time we were friends she kept making jabs at me in a joking way, calling me the weird friend or the annoying friend or the ugly one to my face. I never really noticed the issue until i started to dread hanging out with her and started to make my own friends and avoid her. The last straw was when i finally made new friends and she became jealous and thought i was changing. I just cut her off and never said a word to her again until senior year.\n\nDuring senior year she began to go out with my friend and i made my peace with her being in my life internally, and began to talk to her to try to make her feel comfortable. At the end of senior year her boyfriend and i had a fight and i expected to never see either of them again.\n\nThe issue is that in my high school, because of Covid, everyone had twitter and would regularly tweet at each other and about each other. However there is a thing called subtweeting where you talk about someone in vague terms so that everyone knows who its about but it really could be about anything. Its been 1 and a half years since senior year and since then she has started fights on twitter with me and my friends, as well as subtweeting things about me that i know are about me because theyre timed around my birthday or when i post or theyre things she used to say to me when we were kids. \n\nI generally dont respond back but everytime i see one i feel like im in middle school again. We\u2019re all college aged and don\u2019t go to the same school and im at a loss for what to do. Do i just leave it alone and ignore it?

I need some serious advice, feedback, and\/or support. \n\n2 and a half years ago, my daughter completed ending her life. Obviously, very traumatic for my family. She was in a relationship with someone for three years at the time (here referred to as \u201cboyfriend\u201d)\n\nPrior to that relationship, she had a boyfriend that was a total asshat(\u201cthe ex\u201d). Really horrible person and continues to be so to this day. She had not had a relationship with or any contact with him for over 4 years before her death.  \n\nAfter her death, her Facebook page was memorialized, so we are unable to make any  changes to her account including blocking an individual, deleting photos, etc.\n\nAbout a year+ ago, the ex started commenting on a picture we (me, dad, sister, boyfriend) are tagged in from her other sister\u2019s wedding (in 2020). A LOT of people are able to view these photos. His comments are deranged ramblings of:  she\u2019s not really dead and we faked her death to cover up \u201cserious crimes;\u201d my daughter kidnapping him and implanting a \u201cneurotransmitter\u201d in his head to control him; the surgery took place at a hotel after her \u201cfake\u201d death and there is hotel video of this kidnapping; the sheriff\u2019s office & my oldest daughter have committed federal crimes against him and he has \u201cevidence;\u201d he\u2019s going to expose the truth and we are all guilty of this \u201cconspiracy\u201d against him. It\u2019s insane and very disturbing. We haven\u2019t had contact with him in over 5-6 years!! We know it\u2019s all bullshit but it\u2019s distressing nonetheless. It\u2019s just more stress added to our grief that we don\u2019t need or deserve. \n\nAbout 6 months after this cyber harassment started, the ex was wandering around in the early morning hours and pointed a gun at a newspaper delivery driver. Driver called the police, who chased the ex back to his home and then had a 6 hour standoff with him. He was arrested, charged and jailed. After serving a 1 year and some months sentence, he was just recently released. \n\nThe ex is back at it again, creating a new Facebook profile and, this morning, I saw the notification that he commented under the same photos we are tagged in. We reported it for harassment. \n\nFacebook is useless when it comes to these reports of harassment. They look at individual comments and not the entire conversation that is actually taking place. They don\u2019t see the harassment in a reported comment, so it stays. They might remove the reported comments before or after the comment that stays b\/c those comments violate their terms. They don\u2019t see the pattern of behavior. The actual physical threats that are looming (a no contact order is in place). And it\u2019s a trolling barrage of comments! These pictures now have over 200 comments under them because of him and her friends replying to this bullshit. \n\nI can\u2019t\/don\u2019t want to block him or remove our tags (as we shouldn\u2019t have to) because we need to document them as evidence so we can charge him with cyberstalking (which is legally tricky b\/c of what is defined as cyberstalking) on top of whatever physical, threatening actions he might attempt. \n\nSo\u2026.what comments, advice, feedback, questions or technical assistance do you have?","Score":8,"Total_comments":9}

I decided to write a short article about it one year ago. I am with you. <3","Author":"Unknown","Timestamp":1692708580000,"Text":"Everything started in 2013.\n\nI was only seventeen. I had just argued with a few friends of mine. As you can imagine, we started\n\nto hate each other.\n\nI pretended I didn't care about it for a while, even if it did. I was blinded by anger and this helped\n\nme face the following weeks.\n\nHaving said that, I had lost a lot of weight, and my marks at school were fantastic, so I was pretty\n\nhappy and started feeling more confident; that was a blessing and a curse.\n\nOne day I met a guy. He was weird as hell. I knew there was something wrong with him, I could\n\nfeel it, but I was consciously blind.\n\nI still remember the first time we glanced. Just a few seconds quickly glance.\n\nHe smiled at me.\n\nHow was that possible?\n\nI had always thought I wasn't pretty enough so I was surprised.\n\nI sent him a message on Facebook then we started chatting.\n\nThe following day he asked me for a date. I said yes.\n\nI was electrified.\n\nAfter just one day, I started to regret it.\n\nHe started to say he loved me as he had never done before.\n\nI was scared so I decided to tell him I had changed my mind about our date.\n\nWell, my nightmare began here.\n\nAfter a few days, one of my classmates told me several people had started insulting me via [Ask.fm](https:\/\/Ask.fm),\n\nan old social network, where you could ask anonymous questions.\n\nI went home, turned on my computer and logged into my [Ask.fm](https:\/\/Ask.fm) account.\n\nWhat I saw gave me chills.\n\nIn just one day, I have been sent sixty and more insults.\n\nI was terrified.\n\nThey told me not to go to school the following day, or they would have beaten me.\n\nThat nightmare went on for one year:\n\n\u2022 You are void of virtue.\n\n\u2022 You suck.\n\n\u2022 You are ugly as hell.\n\n\u2022 Cut off your veins.\n\n\u2022 You are a waste of organs.\n\n\u2022 You are a waste of oxygen.\n\n\u2022 I wish you to fall from a such tall building you have to die starving in the meanwhile.\n\n\u2022 Ugly people usually have a good character but you don't.

I hated myself because I wasn't brave enough to face the situation. But most\n\nof all, I hated myself because I thought those people were right.\n\nI couldn't stare in the mirror.\n\nThe months went by and I started thinking I deserved what was happening to me.\n\n\"You are unworthy.\" I really felt that.\n\nI convinced myself I was unable to love and for this reason, I didn't deserve to be loved.\n\nI still think about it sometimes.\n\nNow, I want you to listen.\n\nIf you are going through this, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.\n\nI can't tell you it will be easy to get over it.\n\nI can't tell you it will not hurt every time you will talk about it.\n\nI can't even tell it won't leave scars on you, I would lie.\n\nIt requires time and self-love.\n\nBUT IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.\n\nDon't listen to those who tell you you are weak or a wimp.\n\nThe people who hurt you are the real cowards, not you.\n\nPlease don't even try to justify them, thinking you deserve what they are saying because you don't.\n\nYou are a strong, beautiful soul.\n\nPromise me you won't try to face it all alone. Cry it out, talk to someone you trust but don't close\n\nyourself in your shell.\n\nDon't be afraid to be judged.\n\nLet your loved ones take care of you.\n\nYou can face it together.\n\nI love you.\n\nI wish you all the luck in the world.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I blocked them after receiving gore pictures, however the same day I got contacted by a person I know saying they got messaged by the same account demanding I unblock them. Which I did. \nI texted the account to stop contacting my friends to which I received a picture taken of my school website with me in it and a couple of my peers. The message stated that I can chose anyone from the picture that they will contact next.\nI tried reasoning with the person, figuring out the motive for such behaviour and possibly apologize for any harm I could\u2019ve caused, however they never gave me a clear answer as to why they were doing it beside calling me a horrible and egoistic. When I realised the conversation was getting nowhere I blocked the account.\nThe next few weeks my friends, their friends and I were getting contacted by the same people on other social media as well as instagram when it came to my  friends. There were lies spread about me and all of the actions that were made against me shared the goal of ruining my image in the eyes of others. Luckily my surroundings consist of understanding and reliable people who were kind enough to not blame me for any of the events and wouldn\u2019t believe the lies spread.\nEveryone tried to follow my advice on ignoring the the negative messages with a few exceptions when it was hard to figure out who exactly was contacting them or when my friends would get fed up with the behaviour.\nThe longer I wouldn\u2019t reply the more people would get contacted by different accounts. They would figure out people\u2019s phone numbers addresses etc\u2026 Although I was slowly becoming numb to the harassment, It was very unsettling getting contacted by old friends whom I haven\u2019t spoken to in a while saying they\u2019re getting doxxed.\nThrough a friend I received a message from them that the only reason they\u2019re doing this is because I\u2019m not replying, so a month or two later I decided to try and reply to them again. Our conversation consisted of small talk and frankly had very little substance to it. When they sent me the coordinates of my school and said they have friends in the city that would love to greet me before my visit. I knew it wouldn\u2019t happen, but the fact someone has so many negative feelings towards me was incredibly draining. After a few days of talking if you can even call it that I ghosted them again, because my friends would still get harassed and I didn\u2019t want to give these people attention.\nAt one point they started spreading a link and even sent it to my relatives to website created for doxing. My page on that website included my address, contact information of my relatives and myself, occupation and some made up reason as to why I\u2019m placed on the website.\nThat day I was crushed, i never had anything like that happen to me and the scary part of that was that it was totally legal. The person information was obtained from websites that either stated those exact thing or website with low security which is quite common in my country.\nEventually I had to tell my parents. Luckily they were quite understanding. However we couldn\u2019t report it to police at that time since we were in another country where we don\u2019t speak the language and frankly it didn\u2019t seem like the people doing it could be tracked as they would use burner accounts with burner phone numbers.\nAfter that alongside with other fake accounts of me, new ones were created, my phone number would be attached and men would be contacted implying I\u2019m a prostitute or escort which would lead to me getting contacted again on multiple social media accounts but now by perverted men. Same thing happened with my close friend.\nAfter that much more personal information would get revealed about me, the people doing this would send me my documents and even disclosing how they found the information on illegal forums with website leaks. That part was very scary but I don\u2019t think they will have the guts to use it against me since it will be actually incriminating on their behalf. \nFor a month it has stopped, revealing pictures of me that I posted underage are being spread, I\u2019m being discussed on forums with similar audiences as 4chan and I have been receiving chilling messages asking when i will be back at the addresses that are public to everyone. \nI\u2019m incredibly tired of this and would like to hear some advice from people who know more about these things","Score":2,"Total_comments":8}

Our whole family knows what she does and isn't really phased by it because she has a good head on her shoulders and me and her share a house so we get along great. But recently this guy who she dated a few years ago (like 2019) for just a few months and then broke up with him because she felt he only wanted her money for his buisness ventures. He was really upset and cried but they weren't together very long at all so it was kinda weird already he had such an adverse reaction to such a short time together with such a low level of emotional investment my sister had in the relationship. \n\nNow years later his fianc\u00e9 messages her out of the blue saying she's sinful, should repent, and give all her money away to charity. Me and her both find this really weird because my sister has definitely moved on and has a boyfriend now but still does her modeling. I'm sure she hasn't tried to message him asking to get back together because me and her have a really close relationship and she'd tell me if she was. The financ\u00e9 threatened to tell the whole family if my sister didn't give her money to charity, and now I find a message in my Facebook messenger with her saying these lies about my sister. \n\nHere's the facebook message I got from the fianc\u00e9 (i censured it a little bit with the dashes):\n\n\"Hi, are you aware that your family member ------------, also known as \"\u2010------,\" is scamming men on dating sites? She tells them that she's a loner and works as a bikini barista at coffee shops, but in reality, she's secretly a sex call girl who uses the internet and phone to get money from men. Her O----Fans account is completely disgusting, full of her spreading her legs and engaging in sexual acts with both men and women, which is even more disturbing.\n\nMy now husband he befriended her and she revealed to him of her pay from only fans of $---- which, she\u2019s proud of for having sex with multiple people and video tapping it for money.\n\nAs a family member, I thought you should know that she has a secret life and doesn't believe in paying taxes on her OnlyFans or Seeking Arrangements account. She's using Tinder to get clients, and I believe that's a horrible way to con men.\n\nSomeone in your family should talk to her. This is unethical and wrong.\"\n\nLike yeah she has a modeling account and uses social media to market herself to get more followers but she doesnt have sex with other people at all, and we've talked a lot about her modeling so im pretty aware of what she does and this just isn't it at all. Plus I'm gay so she would be really open with me if she ever did stuff with women and she said she's just not into that so these are just a bunch of lies with a sprinkle of some truth. \n\nIs there anything beyond reporting her for harassment that me or my sister can do?

He\u2019s recent in the field and really has a strong passion for teaching as he goes above and beyond to help every single student in the class.\n\nHis reviews were always five stars for the past three years and he\u2019s super open to constructive feedback. The problem is that this past month for every single day an anonymous stalker has been writing, lies, insults, and attacks about him on this website such as calling him ugly, a rat, or even a psychopath. We believe the goal of this individual is trying to ruin his reputation and bring his score to zero over time.\nHe writes hateful personal attacks about his looks and personalities and rights multiple bad reviews every day.\n\nMy boyfriend is very sensitive, as his career means the world to him. He\u2019s truly passionate about teaching and worked very hard. It really breaks my heart to see him. Sad like this since this creepy individual has had a negative impact on his mental health and understandably so.\n\nWe understand that sometimes not everyone will like a style teaching. That is absolutely not a problem. The issue is that his reputation can be tarnished as comments online that are anonymous can stay. We reported multiple times to Rate My Prof and they\u2019ve been deleting the comments but this has been going on for almost a month now and we start to get scared. I do not know who this individual is but he seems to be sick and very hateful. We hope he gets help soon.\n\nWe can\u2019t keep reporting hateful reviews every day, and we really need this to stop. We tried emailing Rate My Prof couple of times but aside from deleting the comments nothing else has been done.\n\nIt is so easy to destroy someone online from this platform. Leaving fake reviews on this website takes second as no account is needed to post. Hence this person can post even 100 times a day if they want.\n\nAs much as Rate MyProf an incredible tool, I find it super controversial and dangerous now that the situation is happening. A change in the guidelines and more safety, for the professors is really needed.\n\n\nAny recommendations and help will be so appreciated.

How impactful is rate my prof really? I was under the impression it was just a thing for students to use and not really something an employer would look at, right?  In which case, it won't affect his career. If a future employer does look at it, they will surely see that the bad ones are all anonymous, all personal and very different to the good ones, and that can be explained at interview- if it even comes up. If your boyfriend knows he's a good teacher and knows the bad reviews are spurious, he can therefore ignore them- although I accept that's much easier said than done. If he has control of the profile, I would suggest he deletes it. If he doesn't, ignore it. If it will impact his career, you need to start reaching out to lawyers or police to deal with this.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

In fact, I wanted to leave the specific individuals out of it as much as possible, but in order for me to even share what I wanted to share I had to include the parts others had played in it.

Considering I was once naive enough to think of them as friends (albeit terrible friends) who I cared about (and in some ways, right or wrong, still do) it does hurt to call them bad people but they are people who do\/have done bad things and it's tough to look past the sympathy I have for what's happened in their own lives to misguide\/lead them to do those things- which might just be playing on toxic naivety on my part that only promotes a cycle of involvement with abusive people, something I have to learn to navigate for self preservation. \n\nWhether or not it constitutes a \"bad\" person as a whole, they are responsible for the actions\/decisions they make and they've been viciously vengeful people that I remain intimidated by considering the memories of witnessing how they've gone after others who've crossed them in the past and recalling the fear of having that behavior directed at myself- which, of course, was bound to happen eventually. \n\nThinking now on my initial question I guess I'd say any care I have for what they think is more of an attempt to understand their thinking as a means of understanding how to defend and stand by myself as well as owning my experiences without fear of them or doubt regarding me being in the wrong for doing so. Long years of psychological abuse from multiple people (especially hand in hand with substance abuse) has made it very difficult to see situations like these clearly, especially with guilt and shame I still hold against myself, so I appreciate feedback from others to guide my thought processing. \n\nThank you again!","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I would be very surprised if they sent them, but if you're worried (or if this happens again) just send a message to everyone and say you've been compromised and to not look at pictures sent to them. It might be a bit embarrassing but you get ahead of it and remove their power then.\n\nIn the future, only send nudes to someone you definitely know and really trust.","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

I am frustrated that people like us do not receive adequate support from law enforcement , I will share some background about myself first to show how something like this has a potential to kill someone.\n\nMy will to live is basically non existent and my only drive left that keeps me going is repaying the person who raised and supported me and giving them a comfortable life. I have been plagued with a lot of unfortunate circumstances, one of which bpd that contributed to me not having any dreams or will left to live for myself. having an obsessive abuser online could very well be the last straw for just about anyone\n\nI use gaming as an escape. and a few years ago I got introduced to discord by it having been a requirement for people join. something I downloaded thinking it's just something for a game turned out to be a doorway into a whole nother world. met many friends, good people , formed memories and spent years together. \n\nI fell in love with the cyber world. i could be a normal person just like everyone else. In this world none of my RL difficulties plagued me. I went on to form a community and spent some years with them. However there were a few rotten apples in the bunch that were messed up beyond saving but I will get into that in a bit.\n\non to the present situation, from these people, there was one I befriended and took a liking to. he always told me I'm too soft on the others and that I need to be harder on them, I appreciated hearing this as they labelled me as a dictator despite the fact that they got off on watching gore, no one else would allow that in their space \n\nthis person always supported me and spent time with me made me laugh everyday, we were close friends for a few years, I started trusting him and confiding in him with very personal information about my RL difficulties that I now regret. among these a very big secret that I would much rather die than have everyone know. I spent alot of money and pain irl to get rid of this particular thing so that I could live a normal life \n\none day he disappeared for a whole year. during his absence I entered a long distance relationship and when he came back I was on it and happy. he was livid and would not have it and started blackmailing with the things I trusted him with to leave the guy. I refused and a month later the guy I was with randomly left me anyways. thought that was the end of it but nope \n\nthis obsessive person kept me on a leash with the blackmail. bare in mind reputation does mean something to me especially since I was a streamer at the time and wanted to grow really big. he forced me to talk to him play games , blocking him would always result in threats and him going public. he claimed that everything he forced me to do is for my own good and that he's trying to fix me. on one occasion he even said he would kill me to get what he wants \n\nsome months ago I couldn't take it anymore and blocked him , already endured that for two years and decided would rather deal with whatever he does to me than spend another indefinite time on someone's leash. \n\nfrom then till now it's been relentless, he launched a whole smear campaign about me and turning everyone against me even people who don't know me. he exposes that one particular thing that I had to have an operation for that nearly killed me. he also included a bunch of statements that isn't true. he tells people that I'm a paedophile and that I groom and catfish little boys. i have never been with a minor doubt nor have I ever catfished anyone, I video call with friends and I streamed with cam\n\nthe 17 year old (now an adult) backs him up in his course. this is another vile person who's only gotta  worse with time and enjoys watching videos of black people being mutilated. he also once fought with me because when Bianca was killed some years ago by another guy on discord he said she deserved it because she led him on\n he also slanders another friend of mine and tells lies about her biblically says she is an evil person he does this bc he liked her and she didn't like him back. this is an actual adult and so is the stalker he is 28. him and the stalker has of course been thrown out of the community a very long time ago but they still have excess to everyone and more ofc \n\nduring my time blackmailed discord has been contacted but they said they cannot IP ban and will not work with police all the offered is to ban one of his accounts. the stalker has multiple accounts. the racist incel already been banned countless times and just makes new account each time.\n\nwhat do I do? the thing that everyone suggests is to start over and make a new account. I will not have this. why should I move to accommodate an embodiment of literary everything evil in society. I want these people to be held accountable. keep in mind this long wall is just a summary. all this is years of events. what are my options.

Together, you can decide what to do next, and they can at the very least support you emotionally as you go through this trying period. \nThe School: If the cyberbullying affects other students at your school, it's crucial to inform the administration of the situation and provide any supporting documentation you may have. Speak with a teacher or staff person you can trust. \nThe Platform: Most platforms will provide you the ability to report or flag cyberbullying and other abusive activity. Report Harmful Content can provide you very good advise on what to do next, and have a helpline if you need further support. \nThe Police: Some forms of cyberbullying could be a concern for the police. For example if someone is threatening to hurt you, or inciting you to harm yourself.\n\nManaging the situation\nChoose not to respond: Most persons who cyberbully and\/or troll others are hoping for an response. Our advise could be not to 'fuel the trolls' - it is nearly always best not to respond. Some sites will provide you the choice to silence the person and their comments\nBlock the person or people: You always have the choice to keep or unfollow the person or individuals who are harming you.\nStrengthen your privacy: It's very crucial that you trust the people who you permit into your online area.  Make sure you have the highest possible privacy settings (ask a friend or an adult for help if you're not sure how to set these) and think carefully about who you want to view your content, and what you have been prepared to share with a broad audience.\nTake good care of yourself as well: Going through a cyberbullying situation can be very challenging.

He told me to report the other players otherwise they will not take action. The last few times blizzard banned me I was in HOURS of conversation and THOUSANDS if not TENS OF THOUSANDS of words of heated debate with 10+ players on teh same server who deliberately gaslight me and provoke me. Then a GM sends things I said in-game COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTEXT and COMPLETELY IGNORING the 10+ people who are ABSOLUTELY HOUNDING me in trrade chat 24\/7 ALL YEAR LONG. A few sentences of profanity is nothing compared to the length these people go to to harass me.\n\nI am going to ask this;\n\n(1)Does it matter to blizzard that 50+ players are systematically harassing me 24\/7 everytime I go onto trade chat to start a debate?\n\n(2)How am I supposed to report people who don't use profanity but instead result in gas lighting tactics and provocation to degrade and undermine me?\n\n(3) MOST IMPORTANTLY, aside from my ban, is there an instrument for me to report these 50+ players for SYSTEMIC HARASSMENT and is there anything blizzard can do to prove to me that this isn't cyber bullying in the highest degree. Cyber-bullying can cause suicide and other harm and these players are certainly the type of players to be doing this to people they don't like just because they feel strong as a group and mob up on others. IS BLIZZARD REALLY saying that because I use profanity that they are not going to investigate the cyber bullying? I will start to screenshot it if you guys do not act and prove to me that I haven't been targeted and reported (I must have gotten reported hundreds of times for ANY possible thing I do wrong). What is the responsibility of blizzard to stop this group mobbing? I believe there may be younger players who would be too scared to defend themselves and report these players which means that you guys are promoting cyber bullying and facilitating an environment inconducive to safe game play.\n\nI am requesting that blizzard send me the same chats I wrote but IN CONTEXT WITH THE OTHER PEOPLE chatting with me as we were chatting for hours at a time several times this year, it was not just me popping in trade chat and swearing and leaving.

The judge will NOT hand over the identity of this person who is so relentless with a vendetta that is disturbing.

Take every perceived threat as a bonafide threat. Protect yourself, your family, and your property. Take appropriate legal action. Take action immediately.\n\nA now former friend thought I was going to engage in -\u201cplayground style social media antics\u201d- after she began making threatening and libelous falsehood statements on various social media platforms at myself and my daughter.\n\nNovember 3, 2022 - Accomodating Method \nFirst, I attempted to try and resolve the situation using the \u201caccommodation method of conflict resolution\u201d. I really attempted to try and \u201cbe nice and save the 16 year relationship\u201d. However, she was set on being rude, crude, unkoof, childish, & antagonistic. [switched from accommodating to avoiding method] So, I blocked her on n every social media platform where we were connected [Facebook, -includes Messenger-Instagram, & Snapchat]. I also blocked her from being able to call, text, and email me as well.\n\nSo, I carry on about my life like any normal person.\n\nNovember 5, 2022 - Avoiding Method\nMy 21 year old daughter calls me upset regarding a message she received via Facebook Messenger from this same person [who has always allegedly was supposed to consider my daughter as her niece because we classified ourselves as sisters rather than friends] threatening to burn my mother in law\u2019s house down. My daughter was understandably upset as my mother in law suddenly passed from a heart attack in 2017 when my daughter was 15 years old. I calmed her down and reassured her that no such act was going to occur.\n\nOnce again, I carry on about my life like any normal person.\n\nNovember 7, 2022\nMy husband wakes my up at 7:00am showing my (2) text messages he received from this same female. The first was received at 5:30am and the next at 6:30am. However, these were \u201cgroup\u201d text messages with a total of (7) recipients [including the CEO & Founder of the local nonprofit organization where I serve as the Chief Technology Officer]. The second message was a \u201cvoice\u201d message. My (2) brothers [one in Baltimore & one in the same location of this female]; my son and my daughter all were recipients of these messages and I was included as well but because I had already blocked her the messages did not actually show immediately. [Once I unblocked her all of the messages were delivered]. She began posting about n my TikTok page at this point in time as well.\n\nNow, I decided to take real & tangible action. I decided that I was not going to take this situation to social media and engage in -Social Media Beef-. That is what she expected me to do because that is how I USED to behave. No, not this time. This time, I believe I handled the situation in the proper manner; the adult and dignified manner.\n\nI went the legal route. I drove from NC to VA and did the following:\n     -Obtained an Emergency Protection Order \n     -Sworn out criminal charges (2)\n     -Initiated a civil defamation lawsuit \n\nEven after all of that, the behavior and antics did not cease. She then enlisted the aide of another person to further the behavior. Now, this person began posting on my TikTok page. She knew because of the Order of Protection that if she contacted me in any manner, she was going to jail. However, having another person do it still was a violation.\n\nThe preliminary order of protection was extended five (5) times before the hearing for the permanent order was held. The preliminary order was violated three (3) times before the hearing for the permanent order was conducted.\n\nFebruary 14, 2023\nFinally the hearing for the permanent order was being conducted. Now the Commonwealth Attorney for the city was involved. While protection orders are a civil matter, any alleged violations are criminal offenses. She was convicted on two (2) counts in f Violation of a Protective Order. This automatically triggered the issuance of a Permanent Restraining Order [in effect for a period of 2 years].\n\nYou would think that should be the end, but it\u2019s not. She immediately appealed both conviction.\n\nMarch 6, 2023\nThe hearing for the appeal was held. The Commonwealth Attorney had released me from my subpoena already and advised me that my appearance was required. She was going to offer this female a plea. The offer was (a) plead guilty to one count of violating a protective order and (b) one count would be dismissed. The offer was rejected. The Commonwealth Attorney then continued the case.\n\nApril 28, 2023\nThis is the date for the defamation case to be heard. I filed (1) Petition for Entry of Default; (2) Affidavit in Support; (3) Order: Entry of Default; (4) Motion for Default Judgment; (5) Order: Default Judgment; and (6) Exhibits. As of April 10, 2023, the motions have not been reviewed.\n\nMay 1, 2023\nThis the date when the hearing on the matter regarding the protection order violations is set to be heard.\n\nPurpose of this story is that (1) engaging in \u201cSocial Media Beef\/Thuggury\u201d is not the only avenue for handling the situation. Just because celebrities and other prominent people engage in this type of behavior doesn\u2019t make it the best or only way to handle conflict; (2) actions perpetuated on social media platforms can lead to both civil and criminal suits; (3) behavior on social media can lead to convictions and incarceration; (4) such convictions can lead to revocation or termination of privileges [loss of gun rights]; (5) incarceration can lead to loss of monetary compensation\/benefits [SSI\/SSDI, Medicare\/Medicaid, Veterans Benefits and others]; and there are most likely other losses in addition to those listed.\n\nYou never know when or if someone will follow through with statements posted via social media and\/or texts and email.

I absolutely adore the game, and the community.\n\n**What kind of a gamer am I?**\n\nI'm a very casual gamer, never toxic, never flaming, never throwing etc.   \nInstead, I motivate people who need support. I try to appreciate opposition plays where they deserve to be admired.

I was playing a game when two of my teammates pinged me to execute a play. I accidentally missed it on my screen while I was trying to target an enemy. After making this mistake, one of my teammate started bashing that I was intentionally throwing.  \nMy first reaction? - I simply tried to explain that I wasn't throwing and I would never do that especially when I would only want to keep this community positive.   \nHe continued to bash me even more that at one point, two more added up to gang up on me. I felt so helpless and short of words. Again, normally I would ignore this for any other game, but like I mentioned - we're such a small community that practically we all know each other's names.  \nI felt so bad last night that I cried. If people start to believe him, no one would want to play with me, and this made me feel even worse.  \nMy wife saw me crying and supported me. This morning I woke up with a heavy head and I'm struggling to let it go.  \n\"It's just a game\" - and yet I'm struggling to move on because this is one game I absolutely love to play.  \nI haven't tried to get back into the game and see if the community accepts me, or if they believed that toxic guy's words, but it's scaring me all day.  \n\n\nI'm just here to open up my chest. Your words would mean a lot to me.\n\nThank you in advance.","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

The Internet has changed people\u2019s lives, but at the same time it has also brought many problems, such as cyber violence or cyberbullying.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/teftgt8bbpja1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=199e10d11df1862f028da7ba9174861f557fd1f4\n\nWhat is cyberbullying? Specifically, cyberbullying refers to abuse, bash, insult, defame, etc., the victim and cause threats or adverse effects on the person's right, personal privacy, safety by using of various Internet platforms or technologies.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/wvbp44hcbpja1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6ddef76b43795e82d68e2d18eb2b14b97032b7a\n\nCommon online violence includes verbal abuse, photos or videos containing malicious intent, revenge pornography (posting private photos or videos of others online), threats and intimidation, human flesh search, rumors that violate the personal rights of others, etc.\n\nAccording to a June 30, 2022 report by the Institute for a Community with Shared Future (ICSF) and Communication University of China, nearly 30% of Chinese youth have experienced online violence, and 68.48% of youth have experienced online violence on social media platforms; according to the survey data of the \"Youth Internet Safety Research\" conducted by the China Youth Research Center in 2021, 17.4% of teenagers have suffered cyber violence while surfing the Internet; according to the latest findings of the Anti-Defamation League in May 2022, 41% of Americans said they had experienced online hate speech or harassment; according to the Guardian in November 2022, 3\/4 of female journalists had experienced online violence in the course of their work, and 25% of them had experienced threats of physical violence, including death threats. of the threat of physical violence, and 18% have been threatened with sexual violence. The pressure from online violence has become very serious at current stage. Cyber violence has seriously affected the lives of people in all countries.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/1yvxjldebpja1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9ddd3cab3f75dfdd1bc48bb3903c368ca9d892e6\n\nLong-term exposure to online violence can have a negative impact on people's physical and mental health and can lead to illnesses such as heart disease, insomnia or depression. The worst situation is that many people choose to harm themselves or commit suicide due to the pressure from cyber violence. Since the source of online violence is difficult to trace, the definition is very vague, and the harm caused is difficult to assess, it is also difficult for governments and laws to completely eliminate online violence.\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/4ffs6auebpja1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8e902c50f82407f8f0c27a62e40de2aec81a2732\n\nSo how should we avoid suffering from cyber violence as an individual?\n\n1. For individuals in the face of potential cyber violence, it is recommended to avoid publishing their own and family members' privacy on social media to prevent the exposed personal information from being used by the attackers. If you want to post personal content, we suggest you write it in your own local diary app (e.g. iTwi, TwiNote, etc.), or simply in a paper diary. For photos or videos, you can put them in your phone's album. It\u2019s not necessarily to post these contents on the Internet.\n\n2. Delete any text, pictures or videos you have previously posted that contain personal information.\n\n3. When posting controversial comments, express yourself in a friendly manner and do not use profanity to attack others.\n\n4. If the platform supports anonymity, try to post contents anonymously.\n\n5. Try not to argue with others if it\u2019s not necessary, and don't initiate personal attacks on others.\n\n6.

They might not be able to do much but it is a crime. \n\nSecondly: I would also suggest you don't send the money. Generally with things like this, the pictures never get sent because then it's definitely a crime and they lose any leverage they've got over you. That's assuming the hacker has something- if you have no camera on your computer (are you sure there's not an integrated one?) then how can they have video? If you want, you can get ahead of it and tell everyone you've been hacked, that they may get links or videos and to ignore them. \n\nThirdly: As for your computer, it was compromised as soon as you downloaded that exe. Go to \/r\/techsupport and look in their FAQ and wiki for what to do if compromised. At the very least you need to change all your passwords **using a different computer on a different network** and turn on two factor authentication.

I don't recognize their username, they have a private account, but it says they have zero posts but they have around 50 followers and are following around 75 users. My grandmothers passing was extremely sudden and I do not believe it was her time, she had so much more life to live. This persons unsolicited comment really set me off and i feel my emotions took over. With little thought, I replied to this disturbed individual, and I admit, in not the best way. I said \"your existence on this planet is entirely insignificant and reprehensible. you will be remembered for nothing and by no one.\" I know this is not nice and does not make me better than the person. However, I do believe there is a difference. Their comment was unprovoked, my response was provoked. They then replied, \"why did you write a note to yourself and tag me?\" they then went through my posts, commented on a picture of my sister, \" is there a thing where you're from that causes people to have the midget face? everyone on your page is UGLEE!\" then on a picture of me, \"you look like your mom and dad are siblings\" and then again on the picture of my grandmother, \"Also, she died and when god brought up your summer trip with her, she laughed it off and said, \"it's okay, we both know I didn't want to go anyways. Thank you for taking my soul.\" I am so ... angry? Sad? just full of so many negative emotions and thoughts. Who does that? How can I deal with this? Please do not advise me to let it go, I am not that person.

This subreddit has been allowed to operate for years now, despite being reported to the admins multiple times, which is very confusing to me.\n\nI'm obviously not going to link directly to the subreddit here in this post, since that would probably violate a \"brigading\" rule, but the subreddit has been causing my friend to receive a lot of harassment both online and also IRL for years now, and I feel like it's time for Reddit to stop tolerating it.\n\nThere are also other subreddits that are similar - centered around shaming and humiliating a specific person - so I'm not talking about a single rogue subreddit that has flown under the radar, I'm talking about an issue that is widespread.

These accounts provided screen shots, pictures of me kissing other girls.\nAll of these pictures were edited and fake. \n\nThis situation continued for 2 months. After 2 months, my girlfriend started receiving \u201cno caller ID\u201d calls. When answered, at the other end of the call was an unrecognisable voice (seemed like it had a filter) claiming I was cheating on her. Again, these claims were totally untrue. \n\nAs my girlfriend ignored these, the harassment escalated. She started receiving death threats on Instagram from these anonymous accounts. Simultaneously, she was receiving death threats via \u201cno caller ID\u201d calls (they left voicemails as we didn\u2019t answer).\n\nThe situation is continuing today. When we engage the harasser, all they demand is that my girlfriend leaves me. They call me all names under the sun. They said to my girlfriend that \u201cI need to die alone\u201d.\n\nSo, they are harassing my girlfriend until she leaves me. Direct harassment of her, indirect harassment of me. \n\nMy girlfriend does not want to go to the police for anxiety reasons. She is a foreign student here in the UK. Police involvement brings anxiety for her. I am happy to go to the police but I am not the one receiving death threats. So I am not sure IF I have a case. I have thought about engaging a private investigator. \n\nAny opinions \/ advice is greatly appreciated.","Score":3,"Total_comments":0}

This is going to be long but i hope someone will reply.\n\nThis all stupid thing started from a discord server.\n\n- How i joined the server?\nA random girl popped up on my TikTok for you page and i joined her discord server because she was promoting it in her clip. \n- How did i became friends with her?\nShe was extremely kind. Very supportive and trustable. But she was catgender so was i (i know its weird).\n- What is catgender?\nCatgender is when a person feels like a cat and identifies themselves as a cat. Its a xenogender from the community LGBTQIA+.\n- How did the drama started?\nA random girl showed up on the server. She firstly started asking us questions by telling us if we were catgender. We told her \"yes\". She, then, imediatelly started hating on us and put the \"\ud83d\udc80\" emoji in every sentence\/message she made. No, we did nothing. Absolutely nothing. She just started bullying us. But then her friend came.\n- What happened next?\nWhen her friend came (her friend was GENDERFLUID, keep that in mind that she was also LGBTQIA+ member) she also started bullying us by threatening me & my friend to k!ll ourselves by spamming \"KYSUWUWUWU\". They made transracial words, spammed lots of n words, called us in every way, wrote pharagraphs of random bullying words like \"ugly\" \"fatherless\" \"cows\" \"kys\" \"n-word\" \"ur parents f*cked in 2017\" \"imma go to ur house and k!ll yall\" \"u deserve to d!e\" \"when your parents will d!e we will throw a party\" \"make the society a favor and kys\" AND LOTS LOTS LOTS LOTS LOTS LOTS OF EXTREMELY BAD WORDS. And back them i was ACTA (age change to another).\n- What happened when i told them that?\nThey started saying \"oh so i can change the year when your parents f*cked from 2009 to 2012?\" this absolutely shocked me.\n- When did the drama ended?\nThe drama ended in December (last year aka 2022) and started in September\/October.\n- Have others joined after the girls left?\nYes, the girls left. But after that other people joined. And said the same things. Over and over.\n- What have the owner said?\nI contacted & DMed the owner of the server which was Yakoii's friend (i mean Yakoii is that friend i founded on TikTok) and he said he talked to the girls and they said bullying is fun. But thats all he told me. Instead of banning them he let them bully us more. He didnt even chatted anything.\n- Do you have any proof?\nIm so so so sorry i dont have any proof. This actually happened. I had some screenshots back then but deleted them because i wasnt going to do anything with them that time. But i am being 100% honest. If i will find the screenshots (if some of them are left) i will send them ASAP.\n- Did you left the server?\nYes. I left it due to lots of threatening and warnings that they're going to \"k!ll me\". I literally did nothing. NOTHING. And they attacked me.","Score":2,"Total_comments":7}

It's about my best friend who loves art (like I do). Growing up, my friend wanted to post her art to the world because she loves art and wanted to share hers with others. Let's just call her Jane. She created a DeviantArt account back in about 2010? Can't remember much of the year but it was many years ago. She joined the community because it was an art website and she felt like it was a good place to post her art. Well, I joined with her because I also love art too and do a little art myself. When she joined, she got a bad experience. Many of the users were very rude to her. Called her an art thief for her OWN art. She was posting her OWN art. She drew and colored on her own. I seen her drawing the sketch and then coloring it. She took a picture of her illustration with a camera that was kind of blurry because she didn't have a good camera. But she was accused of being an art thief and accused of recoloring her traditional art. It upset Jane having to deal with these people being mean to her for no reason at all. She ended up deleting her account and decided to come up with a different art style because she didn't want to be accused of being an art thief. But her art style was original in the first place. She decided to post art on Pixiv in 2011 but didn't get much likes or notice so she removed her account. She made a blog and posted her art. Things were well until she wanted to post her art around more. This was 2012. People wrote mean things to her. Telling her now that her characters' eyes were too big and they didn't like her art. It wasn't good to them. My friend draws manga\/anime art style by the way. Those characters usually have big eyes and Jane likes Shojo style. Jane ended up deleting her accounts and decided to come up with a new style. She was hurt and almost thought about quitting art but I encouraged her to try again.\n\nThis time in 2013 Jane comes up with a new style and began to post it. This time on Facebook. She drew fan art of Street Fighter and it was a big mistake. She had some people message her with rude messages saying they didn't like her drawing the female characters in a such in such style. It was ridiculous. Jane deleted her Facebook and stopped drawing fanart of Street Fighter. For years she just continued to work on her art and not post it for a while. In 2017 she began to post her art on Paigeeworld. Now Paigeeworld was an art website based that got taken down some time ago. When she post her art there, first things were great. She had likes and nice compliments. She drew fanart of a survivor horror game and had people actually liking it which made her happy. But then one person came along and was being mean to her and made her remove her art and come up with a different style once more. Each time she kept wanting to quit art but kept going back to it because she really loves art. She made a new account on Paigeeworld and posted her new art, hoping that things will go well. But in the end, she had people now not liking her art and even had a young teenager at the time write a mean comment on her illustration pretending they were a professional art critic. Jane gave up Paigeeworld and went to Twitter in 2018. She posted fanart of KOF (King of Fighters). Drawing her favorite character of course. But she had yet another bad experience. She drew the character Vice and someone didn't like that she colored her background pink. Which is silly because there's official art of the character with pink. But the person wouldn't have it. They wrote very rude to her: \"She will color her background with your blood for this.\" It hurt my Jane. This lead her to delete her account and stop posting till the end of 2018. When she tried again she had someone else try to argue with her and tag her into tweets. Jane deletes her account and in 2020 makes a new one. \n\nIn 2020 on Twitter things were great. Japanese people came to my friend and followed her and was liking her art. Jane was happy because she was getting about 50-200 likes now with her art and not having people be mean to her. It encouraged her to continue her art. She didn't mind having Japanese followers since her art style was based on Japanese art. Then someone had to comment to Jane once again that her characters' eyes were too large. It hurt her feelings but she tried to ignore them because of the likes she was getting and followers she was building. At that time, two other girls began to be odd. They were artists as well. Let me describe what they did. One kept copying Jane's art. Her character's pose, clothes, or what the character looked like. It hurt Jane. She did her best to ignore it but it was very hard for her. She didn't have the courage to say anything to the girl. Then another girl, my friend admired her art. She adored her art but after a while she noticed the girl started doing what the other girl was doing. Copying her art. Copying the character directly, clothes, pose, esc. No one else bothered to care. I noticed but at the same time, I was too scared to say much of anything because I was trying to get my art noticed too. I wrote a fewv posts on my blog about it. My friend had to deal with two people driving her down with their copying. She did her best trying to ignore them but it was too hard. One of the girls ended up getting more likes than Jane and gained a huge followers fanbase. Jane ended up deleting her account again. She took her time and came up with a new art style. Now this year she making accounts and deleting them on Twitter.\n\nThis year, she had to deal with no likes really, not a lot of followers, and people that kept being mean to her. Jane had to deal with people blocking her for no reason when she never said anything to them. Just put a like on their Tweet. She tried to speak to the girl that copied her art (not the one that gained a ton of followers, the other one). She wanted to be friends with her and told her she liked her art. She just wanted to be nice because people say copying usually means they admire you. Well, this was wrong. The girl was very rude to her. Didn't want to be her friend and got rude with her in the messages. \n\nCurrently, my friend now deleted her Twitter. She wants to just post her art and gain followers, likes, and just do what she enjoys. But it's hard to because every time she tries to do her passion, she has to deal with a ton of people that just want to fight her for it. She feels like she is unsure what to do because art is important to her but people keep dragging her down about it. I wish I can help her but I don't know what to do. Jane really is a talented artist and I love her art. In fact, I was inspired by her to become an artist (but I do my own art style). I feel bad that every time Jane wants to post her art to the world, she has to deal with a lot of drama, hate, and depression just because she wants to show her passion. They act like she's not allowed and want to gang her or something. There's a small group of me along with a few online friends that love Jane's art and miss her when she removes her account. But the base is so small it doesn't help encourage Jane much. She keeps having to deal with so much. I want to also note that she loves art because when she drew and color it helped her with stress and anxiety but now when she wants to show her art it stresses her out having to deal with people that are mean and hateful towards her. I feel so sorry because not only does people online pick on her, but her family does too. She has aunts that calls her \"Trouble\" \"A piece of \\*\\*\\*\\*\", \"smart alec\", or \"smart \\*\\*\\*\". In the past, her own grandmother used to be mean to her. Her grandma is deceased now. Her dad is deceased by the way and her mom is not in the best health but her mom loves her art and isn't mean to her. \n\n Let me say this, Jane is really nice. She is my best friend and I feel like all these actions are uncalled for. She never spoke mean to anyone online because that's not how she is. She tries to be friendly but sometimes people make the silliest things up about her. I wish I can help more for her but I am not good at advice and I don't know what else to do. Should she continue trying to post her art and try to ignore haters? It's difficult when there are a lot of people that bully her for no reason... I want to mention too that I also got bullied somewhat with my art too but not as much as her. And she really wants to post her art out there. She feels like she can't go by her real name or anything without having to deal with tons of people being mean to her.","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

I've stood up for myself several times to many of these assholes, and yet they go right ahead beating me down and using their views to make me look like I'm in the wrong and can't take criticism. This is what the recent reply to me standing up said:\n\n\"So it's ok for you to roast others and for them to not do anything, but if someone makes fun of you or trys to bait you, you can't learn to accept it and try to hurt other back? Your doing the exact same thing there doing to you and having anxiety or depression does not validate that.\"\n\nRight here from what is quoted is what I call a DARVO tactic (Deny - Attack - Reverse Victim and Offender). He accuses me of being a hypocrite when all I was simply doing is standing up for myself. He also uses my anxiety and depression as inexcusable when he doesn't have a damn clue what it's like to live with it. And he fails to acknowledge that the so-called hypocrisy he points out is actually irrelevant. In reality the people who made fun of me and put me out as bait are intending to place me as the target of their bullying. Meanwhile, my so-called \"hurting and roasting other people\" is literally just a way to tap through their close-mindedness and telling them \"hey, this is wrong and mean-spirited. You need to stop that\".\n\nIn short, I will not tolerate any type of bullying, especially the ones that desperately try to defend themselves by twisting the whole intention.\n\nEdit: Yes I blocked all the users who did that to me, especially the more recent one.\n\nEdit 2 (TLDR): I read several posts on people getting angry over kids these days getting sucked up into social media and using mental illness as an excuse for laziness, bullying, and other bullshit. What I put in quotations is just one example of this type of behavior. It\u2019s sickening that people will use these excuses and assume that everyone is neurotypical until proven otherwise. And for someone to dismiss my experiences is disheartening for me.","Score":2,"Total_comments":1}

You found a post with someone saying something you don't like, you created a whole new post about it so you can say why you thought it was stupid. Not only that, you are an adult and the post was by a child. No matter how right you were or what that person had been doing, that is a harassment. You have been called out for that, and maybe the way you've been called out hasn't be great, but it doesn't change the fact that the original thing you did wasn't great. \n\nSometimes on the internet we get sucked in to a certain community and feel like we have to take action or say stuff- I've done similar. But that's not true. What the original post you brought up was about is basically inconsequential and you're in so deep that you're still thinking about it months later. Having looked at your history I see you have autism and I don't know how that might be influencing your thought process, but you need to chalk this one up to a \"I was in the wrong and I need to step back\" category. Step away from that community for a while, maybe set yourself a rule that you won't post for a month or something.\n\nI'm sorry you feel like you've been bullied but I don't agree.

It was an archived post and I couldn't respond to it, so I decided to link it another subreddit, calling out his behavior and hypocrisy. The feedback I got was people reprimanding me and talking shit about me.\n\nOne user thought he was being funny and replied \"real facepalm is sharing a 4y archived post just to phish up karma\". I corrected him saying it was a 2 year old post. Another user manipulated me saying \"nope. says 4y on the top\". Couldn't respond to him because he blocked me. Another user yelled at me to leave the child alone and he's only trying to express himself. Then she added \"unless that's a self own, go to bed dude. The nyquil is kicking in by now\". Then there was a guy stalking me who kept telling me to \"grow up, calm down, go curl up in a ball and die\" in several posts.\n\nThey clearly did not understand my intention, as they kept telling me to grow up and it's not a big deal arguing with a 16 year old. But I know this is pure gaslighting. I understand fully what the kid was talking about because I was just him when I was younger. I used to love today's generation until several people have bullied me into believing my generation sucks. Now I am constantly depressed, full of anxiety and self-loathing. But soon, I realized wishing for something that's impossible to get will get me nowhere and people who do that need a reality check. They use nostalgia and wishful thinking as an excuse to bully others. I was only standing up for myself and the other kids and yet people saw me as a complete joke.","Score":2,"Total_comments":22}

The girls made videos together and the parents all gave permission for the girls to exchange numbers their friendship has grown beautifully , they send each other gifts and have been inseparable since then with the exception of one of the girls for the purpose of this post ill call her Morgan and her mother Melanie \n\nJanuary 2021 Morgan has a video where\nshe was stabbing a water bottle with a pen with\nrage saying it was my daughter while on FaceTime (I have the video ) after being upset about my daughters Christmas presents and made a fake Roblox account for my daughter so I contacted the mother and told her that the girls can no longer be friends \n\nMonths in between begged my daughter to be friends by creating different numbers and apps (my daughter ignored her efforts)\n\nJune 2021 she got jealous my daughter went out\nof the country for her birthday , called her a liar and made 3 hate\npages about her on TikTok taking my daughters likeness and putting red x\u2019s on them . I spoke with the mother , grandmother and cousins about the issue trying to reason with them before contacting authorities and the pages were taken down. The gist\u2019s have not been friends since then. \n\nAugust 2021 - May 2022 I had to call the mother Melanie for actions her daughter was taking my harassing my daughter , constantly calling and texting my phone , my daughters and other family members. \n\n\nJune 2022 she's made 3 hate and cancel pages\nand an impersonator page talking about killing and\nmurder her , saying I should put her up for adoption etc. \nLet's not count the times she's played on phones\nand begged to be friends and been disrespectful. The hate pages this year followed my daughters teacher, family members and friends of both my daughter and I . Calling and texting 40+ times in a row , harassing my business pages and business clients in the comments .  I reached out to the family again and the mother has been nonchalant per usual . \n\nI spoke to the parents in August and have audios of them apologizing for their daughters actions. That evening a fake Facebook page was created adding family and friends and clients posting vile things about myself and daughter . The page was reported so much that it got taken down immediately . They moved to instagram posting my daughters photos with the captions stating \u201csomeone go to their house with a gun\u201d \n\nLast Saturday she contacted me via instagram with a \u201cfan page \u201c of my daughter posting pictures she has had saved on her phone for years and pretending to be a fan of hers begging to be friends saying that her mom was making her behave that way due to jealousy and that she really wants to be friends with my daughter . I instantly blocked the page and reported it due to it being very creepy . \n\nMy daughter and her father do not speak they have dug up research on him , created a page impersonating him with all of his Information just to troll. \n\nTo date there are over 50+ impersonator pages of my daughter , hate or cancel pages of my daughter . She\u2019s recently made 2 accounts posting our address which is why im writing this for advice. Im willing to do anything to make this stop. I think its unacceptable that a mother and father are comfortable with their daughter behaving this way and not stopping it . To play on someones grandparents and mothers phone , business pages and to create all those hate pages , and to post slanderous things on the internet and there be no consequences . I am worried not just about the pages but that so many photos and videos are saved in their phones, they have our address and that this situation has gone on for so long. I am out of options. \n\nCan I go to court ? Send a cease and desist ? Take it to the media ? Any suggestions? I know there are laws on cyberbullying and im wondering what can be done . At first it wasn\u2019t bothering my daughter but after receiving so many text now texts from different numbers and her school friends being contacted she is getting stressed. I fear even with a number change after all the stalking they do it will be a waste of time \n\nMore details they live in Alabama we live in new York if that helps","Score":6,"Total_comments":14}

And you're a hypocrite for making a post to ask someone and then shut off responses\", another said \"dude, you don't get to make posts and demanded other people to leave you alone\", and another told me \"trust me, you'll need a therapist for all this protective narcissism and misplaced anger, I promise\".  \n\n\nHis spamming pisses me off since he believes I'm the narcissist, the hypocrite, the snotty kid, and a person who had no reason to be angry, when he was the one who believed responding is not a choice, and my responding to his bullying is somehow narcissism. Yet his standards of bullying is still calling out my \"bad behavior\" when I had a perfectly good reason to get angry.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"wpxxwo","Title":"I really need help\/advice on this.","Author":"Puzzled-Savings916","Timestamp":1660665422000,"Text":"This is gonna be kind of a long story. I\u2019ve been cyber stalked for about 4 years now. I tried my best to ignore it\/block as much as I could without directly confronting them. One of them is\u2026 I don\u2019t want to outright accuse them of anything but when we were close, I was constantly put under mental duress because they wanted to hurt themselves\/hurt people around them\/me. I put their mental health before my own and before I knew it, I was terrified of them. They\u2019d told me several times about how they wanted to kill or hurt some of the people around them. Eventually I pushed away from them, and when I did, I realized how unhealthy they were. How scared I really was of them. \n\nThe next one was a bit friendlier, at least at first. They pretended to be a friend, someone I could trust. I even vented to them once about my frustration about our shared community. I have an inkling of a notion now that this person was a mole, and feeding it back to the person mentioned prior. They began to copy me online, which me and my friends noticed. I asked them to please stop, and they didn\u2019t comply. When my best friend got heated over it and confronted them, they said that even though I was a kind person to them that they just wanted to essentially knock me down a few pegs to make themselves feel better. It made me feel so sick. \n\nAbout 6\/7 months ago I was cancelled on twitter. It was on roleplay twitter (I know lame) where I was fairly liked and respected as a writer. It probably couldn\u2019t be pinned down to any one \u201creason\u201d, but to give the tl;dr on that is basically a handful of people who didn\u2019t like me all met up and just wrote a slander post about me. Like literally a league of super evil except petty twitter users; two of which included the aforementioned people above. I got caught in a moment of weakness where I slipped up (I have very bad mental health as it stands but yeah, I realized I made a mistake and own that and have since talked apologized and reconciled with who I needed to on that) and yeah, they dogpiled me. I know I probably shouldn\u2019t even care about this at all anymore, I really shouldn\u2019t, but ever since then it feels like my entire life is out of control. I had friends who I never get to talk to now because of this. I had people who trusted me had their vents from my discord server leaked, and my own vents included (someone in a discord server of mine leaked out of context vents and screen shots for their posts). They even started stalking my friends just to try and find my private accounts (one time they did find them it was terrifying because they were all privated and I only followed my best friend who I trust). Some of my friends are even worried I\u2019m being IP tracked\/doxxed by these people. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true because I don\u2019t have any evidence, but I\u2019m terrified. Even now, nearly half a year later and this person still won\u2019t just leave me alone, even after I\u2019ve well and left that space. She accused me of copying her @s, but now purposely goes out of her way to copy all of my old ones since I\u2019ve deactivated them. I don\u2019t know why especially if she hates me so much. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s just trying to impersonate me to ruin me even more. Not just once, not just twice. Multiple times. I feel so out of control, I feel so hurt, I just want these people to leave me alone. Why can\u2019t it be enough that they already chased me out of a hobby I loved? Why can\u2019t I just be left out of it now? \n\nI have many, many screenshots of their lies and hypocrisy and yeah, I could make a post. But I feel like that would only paint a bigger target on me. I really need help. I was just told today she took another one of my old @s and no matter how much I report to twitter, nothing can be done. I have a stupidly, stupidly strong need for justice but I just don\u2019t know what to do. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s even worth it. I don\u2019t want to make a post to go back, or clear my name; I already decided a long time ago that I don\u2019t want to go back. I just want all of them, especially her, to leave me alone.\n\n I am hurt. I feel cornered. Honestly I feel like they are just pushing and pushing me towards an edge and I don\u2019t know what or how or where to get my footing. I can\u2019t sleep at night, I have anxiety attacks, I think of taking my life just to escape these terrible, terrible feelings.

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"ue8y44","Title":"My Roblox Cyberbully Story","Author":"Shadow558theboss","Timestamp":1651190675000,"Text":"Before I tell this story, I want to address something. This story takes place on Roblox and back then, I was part of a toxic community in the Roblox underworld. These guys would essentially dress up as comic book characters and go on a game called the streets to be toxic toward other players. At first, I believed they were dressing up as heroes to help other players, but then I discovered they weren't once I became toxic myself. I very much regret some of the choices I made in that game, of course, I didn't do anything inhuman or anything. At worst I was a stupid kid in call of duty who tells people to go die whenever they kill me or something. Or I would just cry about being killed on the game constantly. I also handled the situation in very stupid ways, acting like an anime protagonist with plot armor and not taking shit seriously when I clearly should have. Bottom line, I was toxic and I regret it every single day since it made the events that transpired get worse and worse.\n\nSo this was back in like 2017, I know because I remember all of this taking place back in my sophomore year of high school and a bit beyond. As I said before, this all took place in a game called Roblox. Which is basically a computer game that connects to multiple other games, it's almost like a videogame creator thing. Either way though, the majority of this story took place on a game called The Streets. It's basically a game where you are in these dark sketchy streets where everybody fights each other and acts like criminals using things like rusty pipes, guns, knives, and broken bottles. At first, I hated the game since I always got beaten up due to being bad at the game. But then something caught my attention, which was people dressing up as various DC characters. At first, I thought these guys were helping other players and essentially playing the role of superheroes in a game where you beat people up as a criminal. I loved the idea, especially since I was a huge DC fan at the time. So at first, I tried joining them, but they refused. After that I just stopped playing that game for a while because I thought those people were annoying, not knowing they were actually toxic players.\n\nBut then, eventually, I made an impulsive decision by making an account formulated around the fact that I was Batman. I bought a bunch of stuff with real money and once again tried to be a part of that community. \n\nAt first, everything went well. I managed to form a Justice League of other players who wanted to join my cause of being superheroes on the streets. Eventually, somebody became my Robin since I was Batman, only for them to eventually leave once I formed the justice league. I also wasn't too toxic at first, having rules like no emoting on other players, no T-bagging, and no saying stuff like \"EZ\" and whatnot. But every story has a part where things turn from good to bad, and that's exactly what happened when a certain somebody joined my Justice League.\n\nThis guy was named Adziaz, I don't really remember what led me to let him join but I believe he was dressed as Superman at first(but I could be wrong due to my bad memory). Either way, he joined the league and I don't remember him doing anything weird at first. He just seemed like somebody in a group who was just kinda there, not adding anything, and just in the background. After that, I got a friend request from some guy with a robin username that I forgot. Obviously, I got a bunch of DC friend requests at the time and at first, I ignored them, but then I one day gave in and accepted his request. One thing that I should have seen as a red flag was how nice this guy was, it was almost like he was trying to be my best friend in my life despite me not knowing them at all in real life. He asked me personal questions and I asked him some to the point where I felt I could trust him, which was obviously a mistake from the getgo. \n\nOther than that though everything seemed fine, until one day I got a message in the justice league group that some guy named Racist Alfred was attacking the group and I didn't really see why everybody was going so crazy about it. So, I joined the game he was harassing them and I did something that I still regret to this day. Remember, this was back when I was a stupid kid and said stuff that I regret. What I essentially said was go die, believing they'd go away after that, which they did. Once he did, some members of the group got mad at me for saying what I said(which they should have), but one of the major heavy hitters was the robin guy. Another red flag that I should have made about him was how he was always defending the harasser since the beginning, not necessarily outright saying he was in the right, but it was almost like when you talk to your friends about your political views that they don't agree with and they are like. \"Oh yeah, that's true and I 100% agree, but then again...\" Basically he was always weirdly not completely against the harassers and I didn't know why until I finally pieced everything together in the end. Bottom line, this was what I assumed was the first step to making the rest of the events transpire.\n\nAfter that, I slightly began to regret what I did and I apologized to the account, but when I did it was almost like they weren't able to hear me due to the user being offline. This also should have been a red flag since spoiler, later on, this dude used multiple accounts and I believe there were only two of them doing what they were doing. Anyway, I decided to let the dude see the message I sent whenever he joined back on Roblox since I apologized sincerely. Then after I very vaguely remember the Adziaz guy started messaging me frequently. This could have happened after another event, but I don't really remember. His messages were a little weird and definitely red flags saying rude things about me, asking personal questions, and just being an online creep. Instead of this being a red flag, however, I decided to brush them off since nothing really came of these messages.\n\nThen, one day, I did something pretty stupid by pulling a prank on the justice league. Back then I was a bit of a weirdo to the point where I wanted a comic book villain arch-nemesis to like to be my enemy like Joker wanted from batman in the lego batman movie. Bottom line, I was bored and decided for myself to be the villain of myself. So, I made an account and I kept telling the league about this fake backstory that I said was real about this guy named All For One who was based on the big villain in my hero. Basically, All For One was attacking the league and we had to stop him. This went on for one day however until they eventually figured out it was me, some laughing along with the joke, others losing trust in me, and the biggest red flag which was Robin's reaction. He kind of acted like gon in hunter x hunter after he realized Kite was dead. Basically a state of just pure no emotion where he basically was like \"You tricked me...\" and \"I'm gonna need to take a few days to process this...\" Just stuff like that. Now, I could be wrong due to my poor memory since this did happen years ago, but I don't really remember doing anything horrible as All For One. I only really remember acting like a twirly mustache Villian who was like \"HE HE HE IM GONNA TAKE OVER THE JUSTICE LEAGUE.\" Or something like that. I guess you can make the argument that I made my friends lose trust, but Robin's reaction was almost like he knew me all his life and I had just like cheated on his girlfriend. It was definitely weird and something that you definitely wouldn't see every day, and it should have been a red flag from the beginning. \n\nAfter that, it took like a week or two, but Robin eventually came back. At first, I was ecstatic and apologized to him for my actions. Another thing that I should have taken into account was the fact that Robin was weirdly calm about the situation. As I described, betraying his trust before seemed to like mentally break him, and now seeing him just completely fine was just off. During this time I also had a different cyberbullying problem, which I will give an abridged description. Basically, I met a guy, became friends with them, they were fine, then one day I attacked them and they began to Kill me on sight on the streets game, he refused to stop, and I basically tried to get him to stop with every bit of power I had. Anyway, during this time Robin was trying to tell me about a friend who died of cancer, which may or may not has been a lie, I'm not sure. Either way, Robin was trying to talk to me in the game, but then the kill-on-sight guy who I will refer to as Kyle began to attack me. As he was attacking me, I made two stupid choices that I also regret to this day. The first thing I did was film a conversation between me and kyle, basically saying that I need to talk to my friend about his dying friend, and he ignored me saying he didn't care. Then I uploaded it to my youtube channel since I had a lot of subscribers and I wanted to make Kyle's words known, basically cancel culture. I sent this around to a bunch of people, who either praised me or called me stupid for what I did. But what I consider to be the dumbest thing ever is the fact that I put it on my youtube channel where my real name and face are present.\n\nI don't remember much in between that time, but what I do remember is a friend of Robin's who was batgirl began to get creepy as she began to ask if the name on my channel is my real name or face. Obviously, I denied it since I made a precaution when joining the genre by fake leaking that my name was Kenny when it wasn't. When I thought it was over, this batgirl person kept shoving evidence in my face that I am the person on the youtube channel, almost a stalker. Eventually, Robin got involved by asking if that was me and I denied it, but then he once again began to give off that not completely on my side vibe by slightly doing what batgirl did by pointing out evidence it was actually me. Eventually, I had enough, so I made a video explaining a new plan I had to get rid of this stalking stuff. In the video, I explained that the kid in the video that was me was actually my little cousin and I was using my youtube channel and that batgirl was putting a child in danger by exposing them on the internet since she also made videoes at the time toward me. This was obviously a mistake since it basically put those two trolls in a position to hate me and target me even more.\n\nEventually, things cooled down for a while. I'm pretty sure batgirl like went offline, once again giving off that multiple account vibe. Then out of nowhere, Adziaz came back into the picture and began to start acting creepy with my real identity. He was essentially pressing me for details and making fun of me, acting a bit more toxic than I ever was. But I just ignored it once again when this also should have been a red flag. Instead, I decided to continue playing in the superhero Roblox dc genre, which was a mistake. Then one day, I decided to do a stupid thing since I clearly didn't learn my lesson last time, that I should pull a prank on robin. I did this by faking that I had two personalities and that my other one was a villain. At first, he believed me and I thought everything was fine, but then the Adizaz guy came back and began to act creepy again by bringing up my real name and trying to use my second personality to be evil. I don't know if he was playing along with me having multiple personalities or if he believed me, but either way Adziaz kind of ruined the mood. So I decided to out the truth and once again apologize, which didn't leave the same impact as before with the whole All for one situation. Instead, Robin forgave me and everything went about normally. Until one day Robin uploaded a video on youtube that was the red flag of all red flags. It was essentially him bringing up things about me that you only could have known by like stalking or doing research, that I was the true villain, and that I was a horrible person. What also didn't help was the fact that the video had the dark knight joker music in the background, which gave it all kinds of creepy vibes. I don't remember how I managed this situation with Robin, but I do remember it got resolved and was never brought up again. As you could probably tell from multiple events, I was an idiot when I was a kid.\n\nOk for those that thought the stuff from before wasn't creepy enough, this is where things actually got traumatizing.\n\nAfter the whole Robin thing, I decided that for some reason I wanted to give Robin my batman account. I don't entirely remember the reason, but I do remember giving him the name and password to the account, which was one of my biggest mistakes. \n\nAlso for those who didn't know in the next part, all my accounts had the same password, what I'm not sure about is how the harassers were able to figure out that they all had the same passwords or how long they've been planning this. \n\nThe very next day, it logged me off Roblox when I was using a different account, saying that another device has logged into my account. I thought this was weird and tried to log back in, but then I discovered that somebody had changed my password. I then discovered that all my accounts were stolen, which made me terrified and angry. I immediately friended my accounts, asking who was accessing them, and according to the people on the accounts, there was an auction for these accounts(which I believe was obviously a lie) and that it involved some guy with a joker username. I managed to get a few accounts back due to the fact that I'm pretty sure the two guys were just toying with me, but there was still one weird thing that was going on that didn't make sense. For some reason, Robin still had access to the batman account despite the others being stolen. When I'm seeing this now, I kind of realize how much of an idiot I was and how much of an obvious red flag this was. But either way, I still managed to believe his bullshit as I finally found out about that joker guy since he friended me and began to do the same things that Adziaz did, like harras me with my real name, and threatened my accounts.\n\nOne day it got to the point where he and my batman account attacked me on the streets. According to Robin, he essentially threatened him to do whatever he said and in exchange, he wouldn't attack Robin's family. Today this was obviously a lie and an excuse for both harassers to gang up on me. \n\nAnyways I'm getting sidetracked.\n\nJoker threatened me with something, I forgot what, but he essentially said to make a humiliating youtube video and quit Roblox, or else he'd do something. After this happened I thought there was no way out, but then I actually did something clever for once. I essentially asked Joker for details on this plan like how long it took them to plan, why they were doing it, and an admission that he was the one doing what he was doing. I quickly took a screenshot of what he said and told him that I'd report him to Roblox with the screenshot, unless he gave my accounts back, left robin alone, and left me alone. He did as told and I thought that would be the end of it as he seemingly held his word.\n\nAfter this, another guy named Paul showed up and tried to do the same thing as Joker, but despite the fact that he acted smarter, he still failed. (I believe that he was taking advantage of the fact that I didn't know it was one of the two of them, but in reality, I'm pretty sure I could have reported joker and he would have gotten in trouble too because of the same ip.)\n\nEither way, despite getting over the paul situation, more and more anonymous friend requests were made out to me with very disturbing weird, and creepy names. Some were jokes, some making fun of me, and some were threats. But despite this, I hadn't had it the worst yet. \n\nThe day it got the very worst was when somebody who I will call Nightwing began harassing me with my real name.  I didn't think much of it at first, but then it got to the point where I had enough and couldn't hold in my rage much longer. Nightwing eventually met with me on a game promising he wasn't recording as he asked me to reveal if the name he had was mine or not and if I said yes then he'd stop the harassment. Out of all the terrible choices I've made in this story, this one was by far the worst one hands down. I actually for some reason believed his bullshit and told him that the name he had was in fact my real name. Once this happened he promised me it would stop, but that wasn't true in the slightest.\n\nAt first, I thought the harassment would stop completely, but it was the beginning of the end. \n\nOne day, the dude stole my batman account and taunted me with it with his friend on an anonymous account known as DavidOverseer\\_l. Both of them essentially bullied me and tormented me with my real name to the point where I was considering even being on Roblox anymore. I did eventually get my account back, but that didn't stop the harassment. Then one day, I got a friend request from somebody with the username of the town I live in. At first, this absolutely horrified me and made me start to in the back of my head fear for my safety since there is no possible way he should know this information. Then I remembered something that calmed my brain. He had stolen my accounts at one point and changed the emails, along with the two-step verification. For those who don't know if you add that feature to your Roblox account, then whenever somebody logs in then it will show that somebody has tried logging in from a certain location. I put the pieces together that he must have gotten an email at some point saying that I tried logging in from my town more than once, confirming I wasn't using a VPN. With this and along with the fact that he only was using my town and not my address, it kind of told me that while it's true he knows my town, he doesn't actually know my address. That idea slightly calmed me down, despite being nervous about the whole town thing.\n\nThen a while after when the harassment continued, my true nightmares came to pass as he sent me friend requests that all had account names of my multiple home addresses due to my parents being divorced. As soon as I saw this, I officially decided that I was done. This person knew my addresses and not to mention after this he also sent friend requests from accounts with my parents' names. \n\nSo I deleted Roblox and didn't touch my account, my mom and I went to the police but they said they couldn't do anything since they were anonymous. However, I did talk to a friend from the genre who reassured me that they couldn't actually come to my house since it would ruin their whole anonymous thing and risk getting caught and the worst they could do is send me a pizza delivery.\n\nAfter this, I really thought it was over, but then I began to get phone calls and discord friend requests from random people that I didn't know. All the calls were bots saying various things about me, mentioning my address, and using my full name just as a fuck you to me. Despite this, however, I tried to bare through it in order to live out my life and not let this take over my head.\n\nThen, I one day got a friend request on discord, I don't remember the reason why I accepted but I did. The person in discord said to get on Roblox or he'd kill me and my family.\n\nSince I was dumb and didn't listen to logic, I listened and on the streets, he proceeded to beat me up while making demands. He asked said that he wanted my batman account, which I gave him. There we had conversations where I basically begged for him to stop and he said no, acting like the heartless monster that he was. One of the things I remember to this day is the words \"I will have your moms head\" threatening her life. I never told her this and I don't really plan to, but it was horrifying to say the least, and traumatized me for a very long time. \n\nI gave him the account and I'm pretty sure he uploaded an inappropriate picture because he managed to get the account banned from Roblox.\n\nIt was at this moment that I decided to make what I consider to be the best choice of my life and something I should have done a long time ago. Ignore him.\n\nI owe my friend who I will not be named in this post my life for telling me this advice. Because after this harasser deleted the account, the harassment didn't stop since it went to social media, discord, and all of it used my real name and address. This went on during the entirety of the pandemic and it even got to the point where I believed he'd do this for the rest of my life until my friend told me something that helped me through and I never forgot.\n\n\"People like that look for attention when they do what they do, if you don't give them that attention, then they don't see a reason to keep going.\"\n\nBefore he told me this I always blocked his accounts or deleted his posts, but then I decided to take my friend's advice and just leave it alone and ignore it. And, with that, it worked. He eventually left me alone entirely and I haven't heard from him since.\n\nSince then, I've been going to college, I'm much smarter about online safety by using a VPN and never using the same password, and on top of that, I am also much mentally better. Despite this experience being hard on me(which you can understand why), in a way, I kind of always think back to it in a thankful way. Obviously, it traumatized me to have some neckbeard threaten mine and my family's life, but it also helped me grow. As established at the beginning, I was a stupid kid who was naive and was completely sheltered from the outside world. But this entire situation brought me to reality and made me grow up, though it did make me go into a deep depression, I eventually got out of that too.\n\nThanks to another situation and this one, I'm in a better state than I've been ever before, and in a way, I probably couldn't have gotten this far in life without having this happen to me. So in a way, thank you Adziaz, you helped me grow.\n\nIt took a lot of effort to write this story and go back to this hard experience in my life, but I knew that I had to get it out to the world so that some naive little boy in the future can be saved from an anonymous creep that will give them trauma. \n\nFor any questions on things that didn't make sense or just in general, feel free to write in the comments below.","Score":2,"Total_comments":1}

I was responding to someone who had no idea about a certain player. Wasn't a Patriots player but definitely an underrated guy. The person that i responded said, \"oh an Asian knows football? Ping pong should be your thing.\" I was confused and i was only a freshman in high school at this point. The person goes on to look at my Instagram and respond back saying, \"Asian Shrek\" and as well as \"you're never going to find a girl and you're going to die alone.\" I was nicest person and had so much confidence within myself. I've since lost it and every girl I've talked to made me feel like I wasn't worthy. I know that it's not the most attractive thing being not confident in yourself but I couldn't shake the words.

It has gone past a simple problem and annoyance and Facebook has refused to take down the account, despite intervention from our local police. The police have been helpful and went through all of the steps required to have Facebook release information, however, they were unable to return anything of any use or value. This has become a serious problem, affecting friendships, community standing, and most importantly, mental health. We're at our wits end and out of any ideas to fix this. Simply ignoring isn't an option, as more people are regularly dragged into this ideal. If I were more of an internet expert and had hacking skills of my own, I would risk it and try to do things that way myself, it's to that point. But alas, I don't have this capability and have no idea where else to turn. Clearly Facebook won't just understand and remove the account.

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"ske745","Title":"My cyberbullying story as an adult who is 39 years old and it's openly pansexual with mental illness and special needs and how adults can be bullied as well.","Author":"Unknown","Timestamp":1643983867000,"Text":"I have gotten to know some great people online and some have become good friends, others have been sour grapes. But this guy I'm going to talk about is nothing but a deadly form of poison in online human form. He is a guy that is openly gay but has questionable motives. His name is James Carver. And he has been my cyberbully for the last 4 years because yes not only children can be Cyber bullied but also adults can be cyberbullied as well.\n\nAs some of you who know me know that it is no secret that I'm openly pansexual. So back in the year of 2018 I was looking to explore that side of me and to unlock my kinky side. So I went on the adult fetish site FetLife. Somehow somewhere some FetLife troll who started out as --The Dude-- started pestering me on things that I wrote. Of course it was a bad time because I was 2 years out of a bad relationship in which an ex-girlfriend cheated on me. So eventually what this dude did is then started warning other users in a mockingly intimidating way because I put the little bastard in his place. Then eventually before the big Purge and everything, I was on the adult website xHamster. And this is where it really started. Ever since my ex-girlfriend cheated on me you know I decided to just put myself out there because I really didn't have anything to lose. Then one day I got about 10 to 15 alerts until I checked them and I noticed that a picture of me was used on a profile that had bullying undertones to it. And so I was reading the comments, and so I thought it was just maybe another person I know probably trying to pull a joke on me or something, but then I checked out the profile and I immediately recognized a number of my videos and my photos that were on my Facebook and they were given very degrading names. So I immediately confronted this person and I accused them of stealing my personal content and putting it up on xhamster without my consent. And this idiot tried to claim that he was me. And then in the chat on that site he started making mockeries of me and my body and my penis, and started making mockeries of my personal life and even went as far as to mock my mental illness. So eventually I reported that profile and of course the higher up at xHamster ban the profile because they had the legitimate proof and I had the proof that it was indeed my content. So about a month goes by, and then another profile picture of a girl I was dating at the time pops up but then when I went to check the comments, it was the same degrading comments. So I immediately connected the dots and I realized that this was the same person who had stolen my content before off of my page on Facebook and had tried to humiliate me. So of course he kept making multiple accounts on xhamster with the same bullshit every time, but one day he did something so terrible that he almost put me in the psych ward because he almost made my mental health unstable because of his bullying. He did the unforgivable by impersonating My adoptive mother. And impersonating a good friend of mine who I love like family and he's a younger guy and I refer to him as my little brother even though he's not my actual brother. And this bully was playing mind games big time.\n\nSo I eventually had to let my friends that I made on xhamster know that I had to leave and I had to shut down my account because of the person. But at the same time I began to study this guy and realize his MO. I studied all the stuff that he had said and I studied all the things that he had degradingly said about me. So I guess you could say I kind of built My cyber bully profile of this guy. So eventually I went to another site and established my content there and never bothered me on that area. Then after a little bit of a time away I returned to xhamster with a new account. It was then in 2020 that I had finished my first ever boudoir photo shoot. And I was feeling confident and I was thinking that things were going to get better. And of course for the first 3 months back when I was writing about my experience and how much of a confidence boost it was, a lot of my old friends on xHamster came back and we chatted up from time to time. But then 3 months later, a profile that mocked my weight popped up in my alerts. And what the comments were saying were just more degrading than ever. This guy was so sick in the head that he had said comments that were trying to think that I had gay thoughts and gay feelings toward missionaries of the Latter-Day Saint faith in my community. And that I had fantasies about wanting to have gay sex with them. Well here is the honest truth. I have never had homosexual feelings and thoughts and fantasies towards missionaries. They are pure and try to live by the morals of what they believe in and they don't do that kind of stuff. And when I told the missionaries when I invited them to my place for one of their missionary lessons, I told them what was said. And I could tell on their faces that they were getting very pissed off. And I told the missionaries that they've known me for a while and they know I don't think of them like that. So therefore I added another piece of the behavioral tendencies to my unofficial cyberbully profile of this guy. \n\nFinally in March or April of 2021, I finally got to learn the name of the person who was behind the attacks. Because I found the guy on Facebook and I looked at some of the photos that he had and I could tell with some of the questionable things and all that, everything about this guy matched the mo and the behavioral tendencies of my cyberbully, and that's how I knew about the name of James Carver. Then lucky I had a buddy of mine who was able to dive deeper into this guy and not only did my friend confirm that this guy was behind the attacks but he uncovered the real reason why he had been attacking me. So James Carver thought I had sexual feelings for him and the truth was I never did. So I rejected him and I told him that I was never going to be interested in him, and he became so unstable that he couldn't take no for an answer that he took not taking no for an answer to extreme levels. Now fast forward to this year and my time on Reddit and sure enough with different various names and accounts on Reddit, James Carver appears again and I had just about enough of him. So I told him what did I have to do in order to end this for him to get out of my life for good. What James Carver did next was the most supreme form of sissiness and cowardness and being a pussy boy and being an immature little brat. So he wanted me to \"confess\" that I \"stole\" content and posted it on my xHamster page. \n\nNow the fact of the matter is why I put those words in quotation marks is because he never had any solid evidence to back up his claims. So I figured I was going to play a mind game of my own with him. So I told him that I would agree to his terms, but only if he agreed to the terms that I had set out for him. And the terms I had for him, I actually had backup and solid evidence that proves my accusations. I wanted him to confess for stealing my content and using it in a malicious way to commit malicious and acts of cyberbullying to slander and libel my name. I also wanted him to confess to being the cyberbully and I wanted him to confess that he did it because I told him no. And I wanted him to apologize to me for all the mental distress that he put me through, and I wanted him to apologize to my friends and my family for impersonating them in order to maliciously humiliate, degrade, and cut me down to size. And his response was the ultimate form of cowardness I have ever seen. And you're probably asking, what was his response? \n\nHe went silent and he never replied. I gave him an offering of redemption and I was hoping that he would change his life. But nope, he went silent and never replied. \n\nSo to address his accusations, which are false, by the way, and has been physically proven on many occasions by me actually having legitimate documentation and ownership of the content. \n\nI have never stolen any content in my life and posted it on anything like that without first asking that person if I could use their content in a gallery or things like that. Plus majority of the content is considered to be public domain once it is put online. Plus 3\/4 of the content that he falsely claims that I stole was my own content that involves pictures and videos that I had done and also that I have gotten from people I knew. So eventually what I did is that I only posted stuff that was public domain or that I actually had permission to post.\n\nSo all of that was on xhamster back then and that is what James is trying to falsely accuse me of. \n\nThose of you who were patient enough to read this now know the truth. So let me break down his cyberbully profile for you\n\n1. Have had an extensive history of breaking multiple websites terms of service agreements and policies when it comes to impersonation and bullying and has been banned more than 10 times just on xhamster alone.\n\n2. Has tendencies to make childish but very degrading comments in malicious ways with intent to hurt.\n\n3. Does not have any regard for any rules as it pertains to the subreddits on Reddit as a lot of the rules say to be respectful and he continuously violates that rule by making degrading and disrespectful comments targeted at me. \n\n4. Has an extensive history of stealing photos and videos not just for me but from people I know to use for malicious purposes to intentionally attack me and humiliate me with intention to hurt me.\n\n5. Will continue to claim his false accusations of me \"stealing\" content and then he does not have any proof to show for it and have been known to make very empty threats.\n\n6. Have a history of posting blog posts and stories that I have written and altered them to make it sound like something else which would be plagiarism because it was my own writing, and therefore counts as stealing my content.\n\n7. Has an extremely long and nasty history of exposing my personal life outside of my online life without my consent and I had never have given him consent either.\n\n8. Pretty much depending on how it's interpreted in Iowa which is the state I live in, James Carver has possibly committed crimes by his actions online which would if interpreted in the right manner could possibly be breaking some of the laws in Iowa.\n\n9. Will run away like a coward and will not stand up and be a man when confronted with the truth like a little child would be when they can't handle the truth.\n\n10. Has no regard or respect not just for the rules and terms of service agreements, but probably has done a lot of the stuff illegally by hacking.\n\n11. When it comes to a cyberbullying, I consider him very dangerous, and is very unstable.\n\n12. He says that he knows all about me, but when you ask him about it, he can't tell you everything. Because there are things about me that I only know that he will never know. \n\n13. Keywords to look out for are \"Racheal\", \"Mistie\", \"Mormon\", \"Ace\", and any other sentences that references my body and my penis.\n\nSo this is what I have compiled about this cyberbully James Carver that I think not only do the main people at Reddit should be on the lookout for but at the same time those who I consider friends on here should watch their posts very carefully, because he will post comments of reply to my comments using these 13 things that I have displayed. So to those moderators in the subreddits that I am a part of and also to my friends who have met via the subreddit is here, that if any account that describes any of these things shows up in the comment sections that you are to block and report him immediately for harassment.\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this and knowing the truth.","Score":5,"Total_comments":3}

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"sg4bo7","Title":"Slander Campaign against me on social media and I have lost hope","Author":"Unknown","Timestamp":1643529865000,"Text":"I am writing this because I don't know what else to do. I feel defeated in this situation that has been going on for months. I need some outside advice as to what to do. I will not reveal the real-life usernames\/real-life names as I don't want anyone to harass these people even though they utterly destroyed my confidence and self-worth, which was already shit in the first place. But, I'll admit after some self-reflection on my part. There were some areas in this situation where I could have acted differently if I had sought out advice in the very beginning from my friends and family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk, so here is what happened. Yes, I am starting at the way beginning for context. So I was a massive fan of this game series called \"Deus Ex,\" and I came up with this OC named Jessica Jensen to be a foster daughter of one of the main characters in the two newer games called Adam Jensen. At first, I didn't seek out approval from others in the fandom. I did it because I wanted to create a normal character that others can relate to, and I just wanted to share solely for my enjoyment and ideas. I would mostly draw my OC starting on Instagram as I was a bit of an artist myself and just enjoy doing it. Here is something to know about this, I became very attached to Jess because she was my comfort character. I was (still am) suffering from depression and anxiety. I also felt lonely because I was being homeschooled during the pandemic, and she was like an imaginary best friend to me. I loved her to pieces until I met this other artist on Instagram, who I will call in this post Hearts (not her real name). Now her OC was of a female who had no memory of who she is and is only identified by a code that falls in love with Adam Jensen out of nowhere. I wanted to make friends within the fandom, so I followed her. Yes, I am aware that there are ships in fandoms. I do realize and respect that. I didn't agree with the match or the OC, but that is just my opinion, but oh boy, she did not take that well.\n\nWe did chat on the DMS a few times, and for the most part, it was chill. She said that I wrote a good story after sharing it with her and did even come to her for advice on how she did comics as she did them. I didn't ask to copy her. I asked for tips if I decided to go into it (never did). Then came the whole OC Q&A she did. I wrote a question from the perspective of my OC because I thought it would be something fun to do. She wrote an answer (nothing mean atm, it was a question within a question.) I had come up with a response, and I asked her directly if she would be ok with it, and she gave me the green light. I posted the reply sometime later and, here is one of those things where I was in the wrong.\n\nBased on what I knew about the character, I made an assumption, which wasn't well enough to do so. But her response was something else. She could have calmly dm'd me saying I shouldn't do that, and I would be reasonable about it as it was her character. Still, oh no, she sent her friend, who I will call Ace, to attack the comments (note that I was already having issues with this person because she was absolute trouble on an RP account. The response Ace left was absolutely and unnecessarily hostile over a simple mistake that the misunderstanding of Hearts character could correct over a clear and straightforward message. I will be honest, but the response did set off a panic attack. But she didn't go just for that. Oh no, she tagged some of my followers to that post to do what I think was a expose, as if they are all going to unfollow me. The girl who lost all her followers would be forced to quit and leave social media forever, which never happened (I was a tiny artist at the time). Well, that didn't work, but at the time, I also knew that I could delete comments so, that's what I did. I also restricted Ace's account to keep a close eye on the words for my posts from her. Ace did \"apologize,\" mainly after my boyfriend put her to her senses in a pleasant and friendly way as I was too emotional to deal with it. But that conversation I had with her about the situation, she dropped the bombshell that Hearts doesn't like my OC and accused me of copying her (which I never did) by wanting to do comics. That whole dilemma did get sorted, and I thought that was that. Back to business, I guessed right? Nope.\n\nFast forward to around the end of October. At the time, I was more active in the fandom until the shit hit the fan. I was in a Discord server for the fandom (not the one I am in now) and was not as active in the messaging in the server as I was more focused on my school and art, to begin with. However, it felt like I was walking on eggshells with everyone during my time on the server, especially since Ace and Hearts were on the server. Others even treated me in the community that I was not welcome over an OC who happens to be a child. They want me to leave the server willingly (the owner subtlety mentioned this in a chat) and later resort to finding me on Facebook, finding ammunition to use against me and me, saying I will listen to what others say about any updates to the situation and only the problem that happens to come to my attention and take that as stalking\u2014later using that and accusing me as a minor because of the age of my OC when I am an 18F as a justification to ban me? Well, jeez sorry for not wanting to suck Adam Jensen's dick like the rest of you horny teenagers and instead go for a more meaningful OC who normal people can relate to. (sorry for the rant, I am still troubled with all this). \n\nI shared my oc on there, and each time I did, there was something wrong like, \"your oc shouldn't be a child,\" \"she shouldn't be a daughter to a canon character,\" on and on and on. Regardless of my changes to her, they still weren't happy. They changed her so much that I wasn't satisfied with the character anymore. My self-esteem and self-worth were already shit because of it. Also, it didn't help that I was also going through very stressful times in my life. I had an argument with Ace on the server, which we later settled privately until she dropped another bombshell accusing me of stalking Heats. She had somehow found my FaceBook when I never linked it or shared it anywhere, especially on Discord. I did go on a rant about how people shouldn't judge OCS when they barely know them (I was emotional about this and took it to Facebook, later regret it). I did have a comment exchange with who I will call Kira, a dear friend and victim to earlier drama with Hearts, saying how she is worried about how bad the situation is and asked if I can keep an eye on things. I wasn't going to stalk Hearts as I did not have the time or energy (between school, art, writing, streaming, etc.) to hold Hearts, high school mind, hand on what is right or wrong as I am not her parent. But I did say that I will keep my ears open if anyone mentions something about it to me. I honestly did not think that these people would assume such a thing of me, later realized that they were intentionally casting me out because I wouldn't uphold their standards of an oc. Ace even said when I asked if she would expose me over shit like this. Word for word, she said, \"I have no idea what you are talking about.\" Yes, you did. You knew exactly what I was talking about as you did before, and I fucking called it. And then came the slander campaign.\n\nShortly after they banned me for being \"problematic,\" Hearts, Ace, and the others went on a slander campaign against me, from word of my followers via DMs. (Note that I later found out by Arti that this is normal behavior of these people). I, of course, was destroyed, even mentioned that I can easily disprove that I am not a minor, and Lakri, literally said, \"I honestly don't give a shit,\" meaning you just wanted a reason to get rid of me after you guys realize I wasn't going to leave willingly. How did I know they went on the slander? Well, I heard from others in the community who still stood by my side despite these people trying to destroy my reputation and force me off of social media by causing mental and emotional distress for months. Lima even told Arti and Tim to stop their friendship and was bad-mouthing me when I did nothing to her; hence Arti got into the slander target list. This Christmas, not to boast or anything, but I did this cute painting of Adam Jensen reading Christmas Stories to Jess and, I am just going to say this. Still, I was so happy when I saw Elias Toufexis, the actor who played Adam Jensen, liked the post, same with the New Year. I thought I had hope that I could work past this. But what's this? These guys saw that I was motivated by Elias Toufexis liking my posts (the ones I tagged him on, of course). So I tagged him in and decided to go for that. Granted, I can't prove the last sentence happened as I heard from word of mouth from Tim when he said, \"he might only be liking your posts and some of your comments, so then you won't get suspicious that he bought the slander.\" That is what broke me. Is this statement true? Does he hate me like the others in the fandom do? \n\nI looked up to him as I wanted to be a voice actress. I see him as a role model. I know I shouldn't be tagging him to fill the void of self-worth. If you are reading this, Elias Toufexis, I'm sorry for any inconvenience I caused you because of my damaged self-worth and confidence. I am currently on break on most social media, rarely on Instagram and Twitter. My faith that things will get better is utterly destroyed. My self-worth is shattered, possibly beyond repair. I honestly don't know when or if I will be back on to post more Jessica Jensen content if any more are to come. I cannot even play the game or paint Jess anymore because of its drama. I cannot even get myself to do anything related to art. I don't want to give up on Jess, but I feel like there is nothing left to gain here. What should I do?","Score":5,"Total_comments":1}

It doesn't matter if your fanfic was from the perspective of one of the characters bum hairs, if you enjoy doing it, that's all that matters.\n\nA social media break for now was a good idea. If you're not feeling up to playing the game, play something else similar. But, to back to it. It clearly gives you joy and no one should stop that. Then with the OC- create your own community! Start a server with people you know aren't idiots. Block those that are. Share your content with people who are like minded.

I went to the police about it and all they did was force her to write an apology to me (and the other girls she was doing this to which was like, 5) which she later unsent. I didn\u2019t care though, because at least it had stopped. I graduated, moved 3 hours away and started university. But a few weeks ago this same boy somehow found my account and messaged me asking me to come over and I refused because, well, duh. I then stopped replying to him. She didn\u2019t see it that way though and started harassing me again. She somehow found my phone number and has been calling me 200x from a blocked caller ID every few weeks. She also texts me off of different phone numbers every once in awhile because I keep blocking each one. Today, however, sick of the blocked caller ID, I answered a text to tell her I was NOT talking to this boy, nor her, nor did I want to fight her. She eventually threatened to find my IP address and that of my family, and I was so sick of this I just said go for it. And then she threatened to kill me and my family. In her words, \u201cI will gut you and your family like fish.\u201d\n\nI guess my question is who can I call for this? Is it wrong to call 911? I am just scared and I want someone to help now and I am just so frustrated.","Score":1,"Total_comments":2}

Over the past few years, 8+ girls have gone to the police. They couldn\u2019t do much.\n\nHowever her physically threatening to kill me is a boundary she has never crossed before, which could change things. Also kind of scares me. Like why me.

That also claimed to be charity. \n\nIt's really hard to get into how it all came to be but it was a year and a half of love bombing, faked documents, living with them. Just narcissist friendship, that was physically, emotionally, and sexually abusive. \n\nTried to steal all my writing and not pay or credit me.\n\nTo take my work... tried sneakily all week leading up of this tactic to get me to leave.\n\nThey then tried to be extremely transphobic towards me. After harassing me into leaving for being trans and amongst more things.\n\nI ended up leaking all my work so they could not use it. After I didn't do anything but until after I left. They knew I had so much info on them. That they started a whole \"we're pro trans\" online campaign, while stating I was to be untrusted. \n\nThe story I leaked was over 3 seasons of all my work I wrote. Over a thousand pages, outlines, every detail on this show I wrote. \n\nOf course tried to send me a cease and desist. But I won it, as the work belonged to me. They were claiming to be an official spin off with CW, which they had no rights to. \n\nSo no rights to claim my work. Only warner bros could do that. \n\nWhich is just a glorified OC fanfiction around this existing property filmed in Vancouver. So this fake project had no rights of claim.\n\nSo I just posted it online, cause I wasn't going to let them have it. \n\nThey've been mad for months of course! \n\nSeveral others have also spoken out. Mostly of mishandling of funds, and faked celebrity endorsements. \n\nSome people have caused self harm, isolation, and are so traumatized the idea of mentioning her name has put one of our friends in the hospital. \n\nPolice can't do anything as we have no proof of the physical actions taken place. As during the time you were traumatized to do anything. So taking pictures or recording wasn't on your mind. Just what did I do to deserve this?\n\nThis group we have spoken out against have been making sock accounts. So no matter how many times we block, they screenshot, and stalk us. Tagging said CW actors trying to make fake discredited information. \n\nThey use ambush tactics online. Getting groups of people to all agree on something online, and post and tag. I use they, as she has a close knit mob or knew people brainwashed. \n\nEvery day feels like a new post watching us. If we take a picture of our food, they'll try to find where we ate. \n\nSeveral doxes. It's just a common practice changing passwords. But our emails and phone numbers are harder to change all the time. \n\nWe have professional accounts so going private isn't an option. As we're film career people. We're indie so no big agents or anything protecting these hits.\n\nTargeting our new projects. So many of our accomplishments have been kept in secret.\n\nIncluding those who are allied with us, in low profile to prevent harm to their business or harassment towards our new friends. \n\n\nAll of it looking back it's so obvious...\n\nLots of us stayed longer cause our own pride after many had been warned it was no good.\n\nBut when someone is saying they are your best friend, how much they love you. \n\nWait until your so isolated that they can do anything to you. \n\nThey're really good at manipulation, especially the creator of said film project. I was under this spell she was my best friend. \n\nShe had us block family and friends that questioned her. Believing her limited source of info. Including a long list of people we didn't know to block. \n\nThat I let her take thousands from me and my gf... \n\nThen abused me behind closed doors. I was so convinced I deserved it or didn't realize months after leaving. I was put in cult deprogramming therapy, on what had happened. Had only recently come to terms I was abused. \n\nSo now, after us starting to speak out...\n\nThey're stalking us going to comic cons. Including bombarding my friend's first con. This said friend, gave the creator a home.\n\nForced him to do things for her content, to look like she was a hero. Despite being in pain, and tried to abandon him a day after his surgery.\n\nIs trying to play like she is the victim. Making it sound like we're a danger to the convention cast. \n\nWhen reality they are. \n\nSo what should do we do? \n\nIt's all hearsay. But I can link several people speaking out, I have chosen to stay more on text. But I have done an hour long podcast addressing it. Including names. \n\nBut at this point what do we even do? It's all the time, 24\/7. Microscope of how could they hurt us into submission again.","Score":2,"Total_comments":1}

I swear,  you have a different pair of rats every week and you go through them  like they\u2019re disposable. Are just bad at taking care of things or  something? Are you doing it for attention?\"\n\nwhat. the. hell. what the fucking hell. what the actual FUCK. long story short, i explained to them how each of my rats have died and their ages. then i get:\n\n\" While I did exaggerate a little, you do go through a lot of rats and I  am genuinely concerned for their well being as they either seem to die  under mysterious causes in your care or you decide to put them down.\"\n\nwe have had to put down TWO rats due to their quality of life declining so much, it'd be cruel to keep them alive. imagine yourself being covered in your own piss and shit, unable to walk, unable to eat solid food, and you have to lay in bed ALL DAY AND NIGHT. imagine yourself having asthma attacks, being unable to breath all day every day, can't eat solid food, and you get exhausted just by walking. imagine some bigger force keeping you alive as you just get worse.\n\nthis comment ended up triggering a panic attack that made my chest hurt in a way it never has. i was a little worried i was having a heart attack, but luckily it wasn't. they just replied with this:\n\n \"Okay, you are saying some very hurtful things. How dare you accuse me of  bullying when that is the one, single thing that destroyed my life  years ago. You do not know what being bullied is like because you,  yourself are a bully. I\u2019ve been watching your content for a while and  I\u2019ve seen you lash out at your own followers for trying to support you  on multiple occasions. You wonder why people suddenly don\u2019t like you?  That is why. You are controlling and narcissistic but that is a topic  for another time. I read everything you typed, I know what happened and  it still concerns me because you still go through a lot of rats. Maybe  you should heed the advice of whoever said you should get a pet that  lives longer. I mean why do you keep getting rats when they live such  short lives and put you through this grief? What\u2019s your obsession with  them? Please tell me you don\u2019t do sexual things with them. Because after  seeing what you write about children, I can totally see you making  these poor creatures go up inside of you. If that isn\u2019t the case, I  recommend gerbils. They\u2019re exactly the same as rats but they live 8  years instead of 2-3, 4 if you\u2019re lucky.\"\n\nevery accusation in this comment is wrong. i don't try to be \"controlling,\" i am naturally not a leader in any capacity. i am not narcissistic, my self esteem is actually dangerously low according to my psychiatrists. they called me a bully because i tried to stand up for myself. they claimed to be a victim when they know damn well i've been a victim since i was a child, and people like this decided to torment me all through 2020 because i wouldn't write a story for them every day. i don't lash out at my followers, i lash out at abusers. \"maybe you should get a pet that lives longer.\" oh, okay, so a woman has a human child who dies of cancer. maybe she should get one that lives longer. saying \"you should get one that lives longer\" is exactly what people say when they view animals as objects. they put me through grief because i love them. when my cat passes in fifteen years, i will grieve for her just as hard. then they fucking said that \"sexual\" thing. this person HAS to be a troll. they are a monster. \"i can totally see you \\[gross action\\]\"? i am passionately and publicly against sexual predators, which includes zoophiles. i want to throw up. actually, when one of my rats is in my lap and gets too close to my crotch, i move them because it makes me uncomfortable for someone i'm not sexually attracted to touch my genitals. i cannot believe this person said that. i don't need to cry anymore, i hate crying.\n\nwhy? why would someone say all of these things? and of course i said hurtful things to them because they punched me first, i'm not just going to sit there and get punched. they deserved everything i shot at them, especially after that \"sexual\" thing. i am suicidal. i live every day trying not to be. i am on medication, but no medication can undo what's been done to me, and every bit more adds to the trauma, and helps the suicidal feelings come back. my last therapist was not a right fit for me, and i haven't gotten a new one yet. hey, maybe i should find one that lasts longer, huh?\n\ni want to scream. i want to just start breaking things, something i've often felt like doing, but never have because, unlike people like this, i fear the consequences. every time someone does this to me, the puddle i already am gets stomped on even more, pushing me into the dirt. right now, i want to end it. i won't because of my husband, but it doesn't change the fact that, right now, i want to die. how can someone make up a fictional version of someone and treat the real person like they ARE that character? i mean, i am happy i'm not like these people, but it HURTS. it hurts to the point where i thought i was having a HEART ATTACK. i have been going days without being online for awhile now, distancing myself from the toxicity and trying to enjoy other activities such as video games and crafts. i hate these people, these MONSTERS. they're not people, they don't deserve to be treated like people.\n\nmy mind is unable to let things go. i. have tried. EV. ER. Y. THING. this shit hurts me, it traumatizes me, gives me MORE nightmares (i suffer from C-PTSD, and it just gets worse as more traumatizing things happen). why is it so hard to just walk the other way if you can't say anything civil? just go away. i did nothing to you. there is no reason for you to treat me that way, so just turn around and leave.\n\nhonestly? i feel like an alien. i feel so alone. so different. my birth was a mistake, but i wish i had known, when i was young, that i was also a jinx. i don't believe there is a god because of the existence of people like me, and people worse off than me. terrible things happen to innocent people. terrible things should not happen to innocent people. i hate this world.","Score":8,"Total_comments":16}

School is necessary for a child's growth, it can't be left out. In a school, there's people who know everyone and can make punishments. If the school is normal, reporting someone would get them in trouble, making it a suitable way to proceed.\n\n2.) A home is necessary or you'd be homeless. In the case that there's a lot of domestic abuse, one could report their mother and most likely get better treatment in the future by either the mother, or other adults.\n\n3.) Work might be just tough sometimes, but sometimes the cash just has to be made. If the manager starts being straight out abusive, one can always report them, or if in a good position to change jobs, do that.\n\nSo, if any of the three cause one mental issues, realistically, they could be solved, the case is not the same here, on the internet, you have little power to change it.\n\nThe internet (*more specifically, the social medias you'd post content to*) are not necessary for you currently.\n\nIf you knowingly interact with people on the internet, and still get surprised when the slightest breeze gives you a panic attack, then it's a no-brainer to take a break.

THEY need to get off the internet, or else learn to be civil for the safety of others. too many people have killed themselves due to bullying on the internet, teens and adults alike. we get treatment, yes, but it doesn't make us emotionless, it suppress the symptoms of the mental illness. if you're depressed and on anti-depressants, someone spreading defamation about you, exposing your home address, endangering you and your family, literally doing illegal things to you, and sending unsolicited mail is going to cause ENVIRONMENTAL depression, which is something that even the healthiest mind gets. and when it's bad enough, that healthy person is no longer healthy, because they've developed PTSD, which i've had since i was a YOUNG CHILD. and then to be attacked constantly by hundreds of people who know you have problems, and know you're suicidal, taking it SO FAR over the line, you literally can't handle it anymore, it gets worse, and worse, and worse, until you're nothing. the sucky thing is, people think that saying all of this is \"overly dramatic.\" it's not. it's fucking. not. if i could zap my issues and memories into their heads and be free of this shit forever, i would. they wouldn't last a week. i'd give both of my legs if my brain could be fixed.\n\nmy husband is going to donate my brain to science because of how messed up it is. it needs to be studied. wanna know the funny part? i've never turned to substance abuse or crime. people with lives better than mine have turned to that stuff. that's the only thing i'm proud of. but no one cares. if you're not an adult yet, you better start preparing for it. my life was already horrible when i was a minor. for anyone, adulthood ruins your life, and the severity depends on how bad you already had it.

I think I can help you :) \n\nwhen I was 15 I was also bullied. It started at school. A group of guys would make mean comments to me and about me, and eventually they became agressive. They would push me around when they saw me at school. I would always try to leave the class before it ended so that I wouldn\u2019t find myself near them. I could peacefully walk home and avoid being harassed. After a week of avoiding them and leaving before the end of the last period, they started making fun of me on Facebook and say horrible things about me. It was unbearable. I tried to block them, but they would create new accounts under fake names and continue torturing me. I didn\u2019t have any friends and didn\u2019t know what to do. I told my French teacher about what was going on and she told me to delete my account. I did just that. They kept on making fun of me at school, but without Facebook they couldn\u2019t reach me online. At the time, it was in 2014, i didnt have snapchat or instagram. I just used Facebook. So I was lucky. \n\nI would suggest you speak to a teacher you trust, it you\u2019re uncomfortable telling your parents. Plus teachers are aware of cyber bullying more than parents I believe, or at least they know how to dealt with these situations better than your parents would. And also, remember that you are amazing and the people who bully you are as insecure as they make you feel. Stay strong, you will make it through!","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

It can be challenging to ask for help so I\u2019m glad you did. I was bullied and harassed online too when I was in high school. I\u2019m not sure what your current situation is but I\u2019ll tell you my experience. I was always a bit of an outcast in my high school so I guess it was easy to pick on me since I was a bit of a loner. One day a group of kids in my grade started talking to me, I was a little surprised at first but they seemed really nice. We all exchanged snapchat accounts and we made a groupchat. I was really happy at first, we would share memes and stuff like that. One day I see them all hanging out together, they posted on their stories and I saw their avatars together on the map snapchat provides. I didn\u2019t say anything at first. They started to say they hung out together in our groupchat. They apologized that they didn\u2019t invite so, I didn\u2019t think much of it, after all I was the new guy in the group. Eventually it started happening more often but one day they invited me to a house party, I was super excited, it was my first party. At the party they got me really drunk and they drew penises on my face when I was passed out. They took a punch of pictures of me, I know that because they started posting it on snapchat and would write obscene comments on the picture. I was embarrassed and I asked them to stop. At one point they just kept sending me the pictures everyday in the groupchat. Naturally I left the chat but they would keep adding me back and they would call me a pussy and a bitch for leaving. I blocked them but they just kept creating different accounts. This went on for months on end and they would challenge themselves in finding different ways to send  me the picture. I got into a dark place and mindset in my life. I felt like there was no escape, I started hurting myself, I started to wish I would never wake up in the morning. I felt like it was my fault because I got drunk at the party, my parents didn\u2019t know I had gone, that\u2019s why I told nobody about it. One day, my history professor pulled me aside because he saw I was isolated and he saw the marks on my arm. At first I told him nothing was wrong but he kept asking me. Finally I just broke down in tears, I told him everything that had happened, from the groupchats to the party. I was relieved, for once I didn\u2019t feel alone. He told the guidance councelor, I told him he could. I saw a light at the end if the tunnel and I chased it. The councelor and I called my parents and we called the police. We explained the situation and they began calling the parents of the kids who were bullying me. I started seeing a psychologist to help me cope with what happened. The teacher saved my life, I was not in a good place. I felt helpless, lost and alone. All this to say, don\u2019t be afraid to speak to a teacher, your parents or even a friend. I was scared that my parents would be upset that I went to the party but they just wanted me to be okay. There are people that love you and care for you, don\u2019t hesitate to seek help and advice.

I\u2019ve lived with bullying and cyber bullying in high school. It started as little comments from the popular girls in class, then in the cafeteria. Then they started sending means texts on my cell. It was horrible! I didn\u2019t want to say anything to my parents at first, I thought if I just ignored them they would stop. But it got worse, because they would post on Facebook and tag me on means comments. That\u2019s when I told my parents. I was scared, I was ashamed, I didn\u2019t want to go to school anymore.\nMy parents suggested to erase my Facebook account, but that didn\u2019t stop them. They would post pics of me and comment on my body and face. At this point my parents went to school. They met with the principal and counselor. The parents of those girls were called to school. Needless to say that I was nervous. The good this is that school took it very seriously, and it actually stopped.\nSo my advice to you is to speak up. Don\u2019t be scared. And stand your ground. And also you can speak about it with a close friend. It\u2019s definitely easier having someone who understands what you\u2019re going through.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

We had recently moved from the big city into a more rural place where of course I was the new kid on the block, as you may or may not know further you are from the city and there\u2019s less cultural diversity. So I started to go to this new school where I would say a 90% of the students were Caucasian and the rest was a fraction of each other race there is including me being Hispanic. At first it wasn\u2019t too bad until there was this kid that transferred into our grade and would always make these little comments of how \u201coh maybe you should go back to Mexico\u201d or \u201cI bet that you\u2019ll be a gardener when you grow up\u201d and things like that. The person was very outspoken and didn\u2019t have any filter and me being the new kid was very shy and timid in my little corner. Eventually it stopped for a little bit when some others kids noticed what was happening and then it moved to being online. He would constantly create fake accounts on Facebook and leave degrading messages on my posts and photos or just blast me with 50+ copy pasted messages of the same hateful comments he would make at school. \n\nAfter blocking dozen of his accounts and not seeing any results, I resulted to talking with the teacher and had schedule a meeting with both parents of the other kid to speak about this situation and it finally stopped. I eventually became close friends with someone from my class and all the other kids were very welcoming and never had a problem with me being slightly different. So for you my friend I would encourage you to not stay quiet in a corner like I did and speak to whoever can help you with this situation you\u2019re having. Of course it is not easy and can be scary at times but trust me they will have your side and you\u2019ll eventually get out of this and it will all just be a bad memory, you have a lot of people that loves and cares about you and if you need more advice regarding this issue or are going through some rough times don\u2019t hesitate to come back here and post or send a PM\n\nK-","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I know how terrible it feels. Makes you want to scream and cry and make it stop but you feel helpless because you can\u2019t do anything about it. In this age of internet, bullies feel powerful because their pathetic self are hidden behind the screen.

Even though I really want to connect with other artists and engage with communities online, I try to limit my social media use. If it\u2019s possible for you, I suggest you delete your accounts or create one under a pseudonym. Keep a track of all the threats, shamming and abuse. If you have the bully\u2019s name and address then along with the screenshots you can file a complaint to cyber security. I have logged my complaints twice but sadly my country doesn\u2019t have a strong cyber security.

It makes me sad and quite honestly, angry. It really isn\u2019t a joke, and it\u2019s not a funny thing. Cyberbullying is something horrible and traumatic. Many victims feel that the only way out is to take their own lives. Even after the bullying is over, the victim still suffers mentally.\n\nI began getting harassed online when I was just twelve years old. Before, I was bubbly and bright. I loved hanging around people and talking. I didn\u2019t see myself as ugly. I never focused on my looks or my clothes. I was just focused on myself, and things that made me happy. Now looks are all I focus on. I\u2019m not that bright and bubbly person I once was. I prefer to stay at home and away from people. Once in a while I\u2019ll gather the courage to go outside. I\u2019m always afraid I\u2019ll be recognized in public, even though I\u2019m almost certain many of the people who harassed me are in a different country. \n\nI was called names, had photos of myself edited and posted on other people\u2019s accounts, I had people making accounts and pretending to be me, I was called homophobic slurs, the list goes on. \n\nNever once was it funny.

A star person is an identity and should be in the protected groups. I also identify as xenogender which I was called delusional for that too! And here\u2019s the real hypocrite because they\u2019re adult babies! The mods are adult babies, and some are furries ( I have no issues with furry or abdl and am part of both) the normal society outside these groups would think adult babies are mentally ill, and furries too. But these people aren\u2019t therapists and can\u2019t actually diagnose a mental illness! So I got warned and moderates on that site just for my DIFFERENT IDENTITY! That\u2019s like punishing someone for being a different race, or being transgender, or gay! It\u2019s really disgusting and I had severe cyber bullying on Reddit and Facebook too, especially in the Air Force sun on Reddit in which the mod actually told me I was unworthy of his protection from the bullying, and that I should see a therapist! \n\nI do see a therapist because of severe ptsd from bullying, and my child abuse experiences! And the therapist told me being a star person isn\u2019t a mental illness it\u2019s just who I am inside. She told me Reddit was one of the worst places on the internet for cyber bullying and toxic gang up behavior! \n\nOn the Air Force Reddit sub i was bullied so badly about my own military background as a missileer that I developed severe anxiety, more ptsd, and even depressed and attempted suicide over the cyber bullying twice! \n\nIt also happened on the Reddit abdl sub too! There\u2019s literally no safe place for me on the internet, no group I can belong to because bullies ruin it every time! I don\u2019t believe for a second that Reddit Air Force mod is military because we don\u2019t act that way! Military does not act like a disgusting bully preying on weaker people especially ones who were already abused! \n\nEven on the weirder subs I\u2019m bullied and outcast and ostracized just because of my unique differences. I feel like I\u2019ll never make a true friend and had really hard trouble making friends all my life! I feel so hated just because I\u2019m different. \n\nAnd the saddest part is that no one actually takes the chance to get to actually know me as a person, and that I\u2019m truly extremely gentle and very docile! And that I\u2019m very loyal, and very loving. I\u2019m truly genuinely kind and fun. I\u2019m a truly amazing friend and because I\u2019m different and so different from the norm, no one wants me. They want boring normal people instead. That\u2019s what truly bothers me. And Reddit says how anti bullying they are, and that the report button is your friend, yet the mods the very people who are supposed to protect you are actually bullies too! I\u2019m a living creature and want love like everyone else and companionship, people both adults and teens and kids kill themselves every year from cyber bullying and bullying!

The messages were a full conversation with the aim to make a person I was close with at the time (let's call them \"B\") look bad, containing oddly specific intimate information that only I knew about. The creepy thing about it was that even the wording of the messages sounded a lot like me. It resulted in this unknown person receiving the messages cutting off all contact to B. Given the nature of my relationship to B, it looked like a pretty psycho act of jealousy and obviously had a negative impact on trust - tbh I couldn't even be mad, in their place I definitely also would have first assumed that I had sent those messages given the circumstances. All the information I have of this account is the user name and the partial e-mail from using the \"reset password\" function. A few months later, something very similar happened again - from a different fake Instagram account.\n\nNevertheless, B and I moved on, but it wasn't long until my messages (specifically mine) were repeatedly archived\/deleted on B's WhatsApp account. In one incident, I was blocked completely from their account and had to reach out to B to let them know that apparently someone had blocked my contact.\n\nOn the freakiest of these occasions, B's Whatsapp automatically sent out a very private message out to multiple contacts at the same time - including mine and a family group. This happened while B and I were sleeping at the same location. The messages weren't simply forwarded, but typed in the messenger and sent off multiple times within the same minute. There's no doubt in my mind that the person behind this was aware that B was with me and would be asleep at the time the messages were sent, once more making it look like I was behind it all.\n\nTo me, all of these activities seem to specifically aim to drive a serious wedge between me and B, but none of us have any exes or any other people in our lives that would be tech-savvy enough to hack a phone. As mentioned, this has been going on for months now and I don't see any way of getting to the bottom of the whole matter. This definitely created some inreparable trust issues between me and B and I fear that these activities might carry on between me and other people in my life.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to handle this kind of situation? I've talked to quite a few people about this but I don't know anyone who's had the same kind of experience.\n\nThanks!\n\n(NO offers to hack any accounts please!!)","Score":5,"Total_comments":1}

They sure mention a lot about your mistakes, but at the end of the day, they want you to be a better man, and learn with your actions. In their previous post, for example, they showed how you said you didn't liked a specific type of scenario, but how much you contradict yourself by putting these same pictures in your favorites. Instead of calling you a weirdo, or downgrading your likes, he encouraged you to admit you enjoy these things, and did not tried to shame you for probably liking these things in secret.\n\nYou also claim that people say nasty things about you, but look at how many things you did badly yourself. Swoodguy shared so many prints of you harassing artists and users, some to the point of them leaving the website completely, lying to people, kink shaming, and even supporting a suppose pedophile (At least this is the results I got from looking up about Tylor Bowie). To me these are fair points to people to not like you, your actions have affected people, and you still seem to do that till this day.\n\nOverall, I think both of you are on the wrong here, Swoodguy could make more friendly\/polite approaches to prove their point, but I also think you should also calm down, and start learning with your mistakes. By confronting them back worst than what he's doing, then not only you'll be making their points more accurate, but you'll be turning into a bully yourself.","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

B thinks i made him take down a video of his out of spite, but i actually only took it down via DMCA simply because he used some artwork and video of mine without permission. otherwise, he had complete freedom to post that video, even though he did it to TRY and make me mad. note that i also don't watch either A or B's videos, i only know what i know because of my friends.\n\nanyway, in my video, i calmly asked them both to just please stop. i'm not famous, i'm not important, i am nothing to them, this was never a battle or a war, and it's over. they just need to stop. i don't know about A, but B definitely did not stop.\n\nthere was a point in the video where i briefly spoke about gun control. i sang a little improvised song about how america loves guns, anyone can GET a gun, including people like me. now, i have some mental disorders, but the most dangerous one is bipolar type 2, which gets worse as you get older. i am thirty. i am on meds that keep me as stable as medical science currently has the ability to, but if i'm off my meds, i am a MONSTER. i am a danger to myself and others, i'm not in control of my actions for a majority of the time, and that, even if off my meds, i could easily get a gun, especially since i'm a little white girl who is so vewy afwaid of the sawy world. so, in this short song, i said, \"imagine me off my meds with a gun.\" the song made it CLEAR that people like me, and people more dangerous than me can easily get guns, and that's not okay. i said, \"imagine me with a gun\" because... well, if you imagine me, off my meds, with a gun, you can guess the end result, and that's where the problem is.\n\ni do not like guns. i like some guns in video games, but i prefer melee weapons. we do not own a gun. we will never own a gun. the last tenant who lived in our apartment left a box of bullets behind, and we don't know what the hell to do with them for safe disposal. i would not try to get a gun, and i don't even know how to use them. i am VERY sensitive to loud sounds, like to the point where i cover my ears and freak out when a big truck drives by us while walking on the sidewalk. the probability of me going out and getting a gun off my meds is very little, and the probability of me being off my meds is even lower. i also have social anxiety, which prevents me from leaving the house without a trusted, close comrade, like my husband.\n\nnow, i'm not sure if B did this to purposefully be a jerk, or if he's an actual idiot, since NO ONE ELSE came to this conclusion. B decided that i actually said, \"if i had a gun, i would \\[blank\\].\" i'm going to admit (and he's going to be very satisfied to know this) that this made me angry. not enraged, it made me the kind of angry you get where you feel a spark inside you, you're in disbelief, frustrated, and just like, \"REALLY?!\" there was no way you could take what i said as a threat. he's done this before where he's taken something i said and made some ludicrous conclusion out of it, like forcing a puzzle piece in a place it doesn't fit. this is the biggest problem i have with his behavior. if he truly believed any of what he's said about me, he'd have ASKED me about his suspicions (or asked a neutral third party to do it) so that i could explain what i meant and help him understand. then again, i don't know if he actually believes the things he says about me. he is a very bad person.\n\nlike i said, i was just making \"monster\" me out to be an example of why we need SERIOUS gun control. i've never threatened to get a gun and shoot someone or someones. i laughed during this little song because of how angry i am that someone like \"monster\" me could get a gun so easily. why is B doing this? why won't he just leave me alone, stop watching everything i do, and pretend i don't exist? that's what i was trying to do the moment i blocked him!\n\ni have not made a video calling him out by name, not even harassing him by giving him a fake name, i don't watch what he does, i try my hardest to forget he exists, and i have left him alone since nearly a year and a half ago. i don't know what to do. defending myself doesn't work, ignoring him doesn't work, being sincere doesn't work, what will? it goes back to last december when i almost killed myself; do i need to be dead for B to stop? does he want me dead? if he didn't, why would he keep doing it? i have to take anxiety medication with my sleeping meds to try and avoid having worse nightmares like the one they made me have... which does not have words to describe how disgusting, vile, and horrible it was. you'd have to be a 100% psychopath to not be hurt just by reading about this nightmare, which is why i urge certain people to never read it. i won't even read it, and have never read it after writing it. i can't.\n\nB, if you're reading this, i'm tired. i am so tired. i don't like negative emotions, and i feel enough of them just being in my own mind. you can't possibly enjoy the negativity you feel when thinking or talking about me. you are not my enemy or rival, you are a random person that is harassing me. this was never a mutual fight. you are punching me, and i'm rolled in a ball, taking the punches while trying to minimize damage, but i'm so bruised at this point, i just want it to end. please, BE A HUMAN, and leave me alone. if you cared about the truth, you would've sought it. if you were a good person, you would never have brought it. you need to go do the things that make you actually happy and stop hurting people. i heard you've even hurt your own friends with this behavior, where the only people i've lost is because of the lies told about me. this is the last time i'm going to try and ask you to stop. i'm not going to give you more attention, and i think you want me to make a video about you or something, but i've never done that, and i'm not going to. i think you need to educate yourself on mental illness and why you can't purposefully trigger someone with one or multiple. right now, it seems like you have less empathy than me. i'm STILL being the bigger person. this is not a \"win or lose\" situation. we are not having a battle. drama is something you ditch in high school, you don't bring it with you into the adult world. again, aside from that little spark, i am not angry, i am not hysterical, i have not thrown a tantrum, though i did cry for about a minute to my loving husband, who is mentally sound in every way, has fantastic judgment, and would not be with me today if i were even SLIGHTLY the person you claim i am. you even made a video about him once. neither of us watched it. when i told him, he just said, \"okay?\" and probably forgot about it like five minutes later. i wish i could do that, but my stupid brain won't let me. take all the things you've done to me and imagine how you'd feel if i did the same to you. you're hurting yourself too, you know. there is and was never a reason to do what you've been doing. you and A are also ruining your channel for the people who aren't obsessed with pretending i'm a different person than i am. none of you have even tried to get to know me. none of you know me. you need to stop lying because lying is NEVER okay. you don't need to make a video sharing this, you don't need to mention my name unless you've put up your own narration of one of my stories, you don't need to give me any attention. you do need to move on, you need to live your life, and you need to choose to be happy instead. were you ever bullied? have you ever listened to my story, \"chain reaction?\" have you ever listened to \"a slice of blapple pie?\" maybe you should. look in the mirror and ask yourself, \"do i want to be this person?\" because i've gotten multiple apologies from people who decided they didn't. just stop. please. please become a good person.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: one of the worst offenders of the 2020 harassment just recently apologized to me. i thanked them for the apology, but did not forgive them. meanwhile, B claimed he would stop, saying, \"you stop talking about me, and i'll stop talking about you,\" making it seem like i've been constantly talking about him by name like he's been doing to me. he said he'd \"unlist the videos\" because he \"just wants this dead.\" no. if he wanted it dead (and if he were smart), he'd delete the videos and never mention me to anyone ever again. instead, when i told him to delete the videos or i'd get the police involved, he tweeted at his followers, \"reitanna tried to scare me into deleting the videos.\" no, i didn't \"try to scare him,\" i threatened to escalate this because he's breaking the law and putting me in danger. i'm still tearing at my skin because of him (i have dermatillomania), and i don't understand why he enjoys making people miserable, or why he wants to ruin his life. i told him what's going to happen if he continues, that's not an attempt to scare someone, that is telling them the consequences of their actions. not only that, but he's calling my friends pedophiles without proof or substance, and still doesn't bother to understand what a pedophile is so that he can realize that not a single person he's accused of being a pedophile is one. he is one of the most toxic people i've ever seen, and aparrently, i'm not the only one he's done this to. he gets off on talking shit about other people. i think he's like seventeen or something, so he should be old enough to understand that this behavior is not okay, it's immoral, illegal, and is NOT tolerated in the adult world. he made \"one last video\" addressing me, but i told him that i've never watched his videos, and i'm not going to watch that one. i gave him a chance half a year ago to have a civil conversation to leave things peacefully. this was the first time in the entire year and a half of addressing him. i'm going back to ignoring him again, and there are people who always let me know when he's crossed a line. if he keeps it up, i'm going to take the necessary actions to attempt to get him to stop by force (legally). i mean, even kiwifarms is bashing him for his problems toward me, and they're WORSE than him. i honestly with i could talk to his parents, whom he claims supports this behavior. he's lying. he's been lying about me and other people for too long, we know he's a liar. i really hope whatever friends he has left leaves him, and i hope, that when he becomes an adult, he grows some empathy and is plagued by guilt for the rest of his life. he needs to stop talking about other people, not just me, but everyone, and he needs to stop on every platform. can someone explain to me how this guy thinks? is he trying to get attention? is he miserable with himself and takes it out on others? is he in love with me??? how can someone live their life hurting people like this and not feel bad? how can anyone lie so easily without it tearing them apart on the inside? how can someone feel happiness AT ALL while living like this? i don't understand it, and me and his other victims DO NOT deserve it. and here's me hoping he gets doxxed just so i can write a letter to his parents, and then my brain is like, \"well, YOU may want to just send a letter, but other people might want to actually go to his address and do something really bad,\" and that's where i'm like... why can't humans just be GOOD? i don't know, i'm rambling now. i have a theory that he might be an actual pedophile, but it's just a theory... a hunch, more like, but still, i do not have the grounds to say, \"B, you are a pedophile.\" funny, because that's exactly what he said about me, even though it's IMPOSSIBLE for me to be one. but B doesn't use logic, he just talks. B, if you can't say anything civil, don't say anything at all. you don't have to be NICE, you just have to be human. you're quickly ridding yourself of your own humanity. i would not be shocked to hear you did something unspeakable to someone to land you in prison. leave EVERYONE alone.","Score":7,"Total_comments":5}

I've started a grassroots group earlier this month to demand change from political leaders to hold businesses accountable for failing at their corporate social responsibility, especially regarding enabling abuse to the 2SLGBTQIA+ community. As a trans woman, I have continually been on the receiving end of online abuse & cybercrime since last September, at least by what I've shared visibly because it's something that I've experienced my whole life. This experience starts from a local radio station failing at their public commitment to allyship. I invite you to add your voice to make it known that you agree that responsibility for safer & stronger communities starts from up top! [https:\/\/act.newmode.net\/action\/hirewheller\/csr](https:\/\/act.newmode.net\/action\/hirewheller\/csr)\n2. I will be on Instagram Live tonight at 7 pm Central to discuss my lived experience as a trans woman. Believe me when I say that being on the receiving end of online abuse isn't new or fun to me & while my session focuses on trans issues, the conversation is intersectional.

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"nnwfpf","Title":"Backstabbing \"Friend\" Story","Author":"FifiiMensah","Timestamp":1622322797000,"Text":"A few months ago I had to deal with a backstabber who I used to be good friends with. I'm going to refer to this guy as Guy 1. We first met back in junior high however didn't become close until during our high school years. He was a computer and video game nerd and I was one as well so we both connected well. Eventually we all graduated and went our own ways. However near the end of May of last year, I got a message from a different guy (I'm going to refer him to as Guy 2) and here's what it said:\n\n\"Salutations (My name), do you ever feel like seeing a doctor? Because you should. Look how much of a narcissist you are. And also, imagine being so delusional that you think you\u2019re some influential leader in this world when you have no idea how the world works. You\u2019re just a wannabe who thinks you left some sort of \u201clegacy\u201d at (My High School) when no one cares. Literally no one cares. Grow up and face it, you don\u2019t know what reality is because you\u2019ve grown delusional in your bubble. It doesn\u2019t help when you\u2019re a hypocrite as well. You know you\u2019re a borderline stalker. Who has time to dedicate every Minecraft house to your fellow seniors? The fact that you\u2019re so invested in other people's lives trying to collect information on where they live, when their birthday is, all that bs is already concerning enough. You have so much time to complain and rant on social media but what does that do? Do you contribute anything to the community with your worthless rants? Why stalk your peers? Trying to do something with it? Don\u2019t try to hide your innocence with your two-face.\u00a0 I know you even refer to your classmates as \u201cinferior\u201d just imagine if they knew your objective\".\n\nWhen I saw his message, I then proceeded to block him and move on. However less than two weeks later, I decided to start a digital yearbook signing page and someone started putting hateful, inappropriate, racist, homosexual messages. I won't post any pictures of them due to anoymousity however I can show you them if you PM me, so here are just a few examples of what they said:\n\n\"You're just a little bitch.\"\n\n\"You seriously need to see a psychiatrist.\"\n\n\"You scare every single girl at the school.\"\n\n\"He's going to continue stalking his classmates for as long as he lives!\"\n\n\"You could've gone to night school to fit into your environment better.\"\n\n\"Keep deleting these comments and you'll eventually be placed on my hit list.\"\n\nThey even tried acting like one of my friends who I was close to growing up along with a few of my classmates that I went to school with and even went to the point where they acted like one of my former teachers from middle school pretending that they said that I \"sucked\" in their class.\n\nI had no clue who was putting those messages at the time and all I knew was that it was someone I went to middle and high school with.\n\nAfter some of those comments showed up. I then unblocked Guy 2 due to how some of the messages were similar to what he said and questioned him. He said that he didn't due to how I had him blocked. He also said that I needed to learn how to take criticism and that I should ask the rest of my classmates about what's going on. After a while of talking to him, I removed him and reblocked him again.\n\nThey continued to put so many of those messages to the point where I actually deleted the digital yearbook signing page all together so they could no longer put those messages. However it didn't stop there, they would start putting some of those comments through anonymous apps and websites every now and then mainly making jokes about my eyes.\n\nHowever abour nine months later near the end of February, while I was in the process of having a conversation with Guy 1 about something unrelated to those messages. He \"accidentally\" sent in a picture of our conversation with my contact name being \"Fucking Creeper\". I then finally figured out that he was behind those comments the whole time. Him being the coward he was, as soon I started questioning him, he then proceeded to block me on all of his social media platforms.\u00a0\n\nAbout a month later I found out a way to message Guy 1 where he hasn't blocked me and asked him why he did that stuff. He then told me the whole entire truth that although it wasn't him, it was Guy 2 who sent in those messages in the whole entire time, but he helped him by sending the links of the anonymous stuff to him due to how he was a friend of his. He also said that he didn't like me this whole time and that he would talk behind my back around Guy 2. He explained that the picture of our conversation was meant for Guy 2 for entertainment for the two of them to laugh and trash talk about me.\u00a0\n\nMe and Guy 1 are no longer friends to this day and I don't plan on speaking to him anytime soon due to what he did.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

It makes you wonder how many people you can really trust, and how much of the betrayal was really your fault. It's even worse when you know you've told that person sensitive information and they use it against you.

Unfortunately sometimes you have to let go. If a social media site is doing more damage than good, walk away from it. I joined a social media platform which is now gone but had I known how toxic the site was, I honestly never would have joined. In my experience the people doing the bullying have most likely been bullied themselves and then take their frustrations out on other people.

Long story short we ended up creating a group chat to organise meetings and so on. Idk what I did but they seem to think im a weirdo and created a 2nd group chat, which im not a part of. In this group they make fun of me all the time, they found my facebook profile and share my old pictures\/posts. I dont feet confortable talking to my professor about the situation because of how embarrassing it is.

I can offer to do the interview in english and german. Only the audio will be recorded, later on  transcribed  and analyzed, so you don t need to use the camera in case you want to stay  anonymous.

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"mmrbyv","Title":"How to handle cyberbullying - a therapist's perspective","Author":"danielrosehill","Timestamp":1617887068000,"Text":"I see a therapist irregularly. I had the chance to do so this morning and I discussed, with her, some of the nasty (and unrelenting) cyberbullying that I've received on Reddit over the past week or so. I really took it to heart.\n\nI wouldn't post *my* recommendations for what to do with this. Because I'm not a mental health professional.\n\nBut I'm happy to be the scribe that reports back on what she recommended. I dictated my notes right after the session so I'd be confident that this is 90%+ an accurate recall of her thoughts:\n\n# See it from a higher perspective or that of an objective third party\n\nI was very curious to know whether or not she would agree with the common advice \"don't feed the trolls.\" That was basically what she recommended. But she also advocated for seeing things from a \"higher\" perspective.\n\nRight now, I have a couple of \"Renemies\" following me around threads here (and the internet) saying nasty things about me. Some of those are ad-hominems (your nose is too big, four letter expletives, you have Asperger's) and some of those are outright lies (you're harassing other Redditors).\n\nFor category A (insults): there's no need to dignify these with a response. Anybody rational can see that you're being targeted. By all means report such things to Reddit. But responding \"hey, my nose isn't big!\" just goads the trolls (I mostly managed to avoid this one).\n\nFor category B (lies): I realized yesterday that there's no way to prevent people lying about you on Reddit or anywhere else on the internet. It's just too big a place and when trolls congregate\/brigade ... unless you have a team working with you you're just not going to have the man (or woman)-power to combat the disinformation.\n\nYesterday I posted a link on Medium explaining that I've been bullied on Reddit. The purpose was that I can link to it in case of any egregious lies. She thought that was a reasonable approach.\n\n# People's need for truth \/ to \"set the record straight\" \u2014 inevitable but ultimately futile\n\nContinuing with the thing about lies: I believe there's a natural instinct for humans to \"set the record straight\" and defend their reputations that I certainly share.\n\nHowever, again, when it comes to online bullying you have to realize that attempting to defend your reputation 100% is just kind of impossible.\n\nThe more you put yourself out there \u2014 let's say you're a politician or a journalist \u2014 the more cyberbullying, abuse, and harassment you can expect to receive. That's just how it works.\n\nMy guess is that at some point many people in the above category go through a painful growth experience such as this one and just decide to take a *de minimis* attitude to online bullying and abuse: responding to serious allegations and letting the rest slide.\n\nYes, it's kind of sucky - but ultimately it's better to understand that you can't defend the truth in its entirety and that disinformation and lies are unfortunately the inevitable and ugly side of the information-filled society that we humans have created with ourselves with the internet.\n\nHope that was of some use to somebody!\n\n\\- Daniel.","Score":6,"Total_comments":8}

{"Type":"Comment","Post_id":"mmxuh7","Title":"Should you give trolls a space to leave hateful comments?","Author":"danielrosehill","Timestamp":1617909263000,"Text":"Hi,\n\nYou \u2014and others \u2014 seem intent on bringing everything down to the level of ad-hominem.\n\nThis thread isn't \"to attack other users.\"\n\nIt's a simple question, on a forum for cyberbullying (I think its natural home) as to whether it's best to leave a comments section that will receive cyberabuse open or whether it should be closed. There is no malicious motive here or an attempt to harass anybody. I would simply be interested in hearing the perspectives of others in a community for discussing cyberbullying!\n\n>Not only do you openly admit to using alts to manipulate your own standing, you are clearly in support of alt accounts except for where it personally makes your life difficult.\n\nYou are correct in saying that I am absolutely in favor of alt accounts and online anonymity. I apologized to the moderator of the subreddit on which I (on a single handful of occasions, I believe) commented from two accounts on the one thread. But I would argue that even that is an act of dubious \"sin\". I don't believe that Reddit bans users from holding multiple accounts and I think there are plenty of times where keeping one public and one private identity makes sense (I'm doing that currently).\n\nWhere Scarlit did have a point I agreed with was that commenting on threads I started from another account was a deceptive thing to do. Given that people are not generally in the habit of talking to themselves your average user would read the thread and believe it were somebody else talking. So that's misleading and deceptive.\n\nHe\/she explained that she cared about the integrity of that community and I understood and accepted that. But I still don't think that gives her grounds to claim that I'm a \"sociopath,\" a \"social deviant,\" and \"precisely the type of person I will avoid .. 100% full of shit.\" Everybody makes mistakes, in both the real life and online realms and this was one of mine. But because somebody does something dumb (online) a few times doesn't make them a sociopath, as he\/she claimed, or give them permission to continue hurling insults at them.\n\nWhat you \/ whoever wrote was:\n\n>I agree with all of this. Also the poster\u2019s going into another subreddit with alt accounts to harass another user of both subs.\n\nIn the context in which this was stated, I believe it was reasonable for anybody reading to assume that this was in relation to the issue at hand and not something that happened months in the past (this was how I interpreted the thread). I currently maintain one \"alt\" account (besides danielrosehill2 -- which I used solely for the purpose of attempting to make amends with Scarlit). I use it almost exclusively for discussing ADHD and related issues. So no, I don't have active \"alts\" (in the plural). And I don't believe I've ever intentionally harassed other users on Reddit (in contrast, it was Scarlit who dredged up my posting incident in an unrelated community something like a month later).\n\nAlso: I didn't set up danielrosehill2 to harass Scarlit. Quite the opposite -- I created it simply because I didn't want to unblock her from my main account (I was sick of seeing the messages). But in response to trying to start a dialogue I received a string of insults. The message was clear and I haven't touched the account since as can be seen in the posting history.\n\nI actually really doubt that this is your real identity. Why? Because if you were any of the haters that have called me \"ugly AF,\" \"big nosed\" (repeatedly) in past few days ... I'm not sure you'd want to admit to that publicly.\n\nIn summary: yes, I stand for alt accounts. I also realize and appreciate the fact that the various mental health communities here on Reddit (inter alia) facilitate good.\n\nHowever, in relation to the issue you raised, I don't think that one misdeed should give an anonymous user free reign to lay into and attack another. That is a type of anonymity that I don't think serves the Reddit community at large.\n\n\\- Daniel.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I also think that anonymity is what leads to so much of the crappiness you encounter on here. So in a sense it's a deliberate stand against that. \n\nI mostly engage in communities about writing and marketing. I seem to have made two extremely determined enemies through posting about... writing basically.\n\nThe first took issue with something stupid that I did (when I was getting used to commenting publicly I was using both this account and an alt for a while and on several occasions commented on my own threads.) My behaviour was out of line but the torrent of abuse this person sent back was way OTT.\n\nThe second Redditor seems to stalk me around threads attacking whatever I write. Literally 50% of their comment history is pouncing on whatever I write. I've blocked the user but can see, by what a friendly Redditor tells me, that the behaviour persists. This greatly weirds me out. Who is this randomer who knows who I am but attacks me from behind a username? And why do they hate me so much? \n\nMost people here seem decent even when we have differences of opinion. But there's also often an underlying nastiness that really bums me out. A basic respect and decorum for other posters that seems sorely lacking. I LOVE the concept of Reddit but I think that the anonymity it affords makes it an online nirvana for haters and bullies of every variety. \n\nAs bad as some of my experiences have been here I also feel like they represent an opportunity for me to grow as a person and that quitting the network entirely would be a form of avoidance - so I try to persist. There are bullies and jerks everywhere and - as I work as a writer - I'm going to have to learn to deal with people who hate what I do sooner or later. It also seems that the haters of Reddit just like to hate - - it doesn't matter what you post or where, if they want to insult you they'll latch onto anything. \n\nAlso down voting... I literally never down vote even when people are being abusive to me. I get its purpose but its constantly abused as a minor but very pervasive form of bullying. Another facet of Reddit that simply sucks. \n\nI've met some really cool people here including one IRL. But the few nasty and very determined haters I've attracted really get me down sometimes.

I\u2019m not proud of who I was back then, but I\u2019m happy I finally realised that what I was doing was harmful to others and to myself. \n\nI\u2019m writing this post to help other people understand why antis\/haters are the way they are. I\u2019m not claiming this will 100% be the case for everyone or that the following explanations are excuses. There are no excuses for cyberbullying. This is just my personal experience. It may be important to note that I behaved like this from 2015 to 2019, and online spaces have changed a bit since then. \n\nLet's just get into it. \n\nThe main reason for my poor online behaviour was a lack of self-confidence. I know this might sound clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s true\u2014I had a lot of inner hate towards myself, and seeing other people be themselves unapologetically was very triggering. I was ashamed of my hobbies and I saw myself as a weirdo for liking certain things\/fandoms\/ships. So, watching how other people were happy in their skin made me feel bad. The solution? Attack. I wanted to make them feel as miserable as I felt all the time, so I resorted to hate. Hating others is easier than facing the fact that you hate yourself. \n\nThat lack of self-confidence also translated into feeling \u2018small\u2019 in my real life. I wasn\u2019t very popular (although I wasn\u2019t an outcast either), and overall I wasn\u2019t satisfied with my social status at school. Being hateful online gave me a lot of \u2018clout\u2019, approval from other users, and it made me feel like a bigger person. I finally got the attention I had craved for so long, and that I lacked in my real life. Even if I was wrong in my actions, nitpicking on everything and anything always made me feel like some kind of superior moral judge, and other people seemed to like it. So I went on with it. \n\nIf you\u2019re wondering why haters in your fandom are such fans of cancel culture, are obsessed with exposing others and say rude things about harmless stuff for no reason, this might be why. It\u2019s definitely why I did it. Also, it\u2019s easy to be hateful when you\u2019re not actually interacting with the other person face to face. It gives you the false impression that you\u2019re talking to a void. \n\nTo be honest, the only feeling they should evoke in you is sadness. They\u2019re not worth getting angry with. These people aren\u2019t happy in their own skin, and perpetuating this online behaviour will only feed into the vicious hate circle they\u2019re stuck in. You can\u2019t do anything about their toxicity because they won\u2019t listen\u2014I used to believe I was right all the time, and I thought everyone was attacking me even if they were being polite. I was blinded by hatred. \n\nThis poor behaviour definitely affected my relationship with friends and family, and I lost many friends because of it. When you\u2019ve been a hater for so long, the fine line between real life and the online world blurs out until it disappears. Not only was I being toxic online, but my actual, day-to-day thoughts were poisoned too. I started treating people I was close with very poorly, and I became extremely judgemental (mirroring my online persona). This was without a doubt the worst period of my life. \n\nSadly, you can\u2019t do anything about them. They're lost until they find themselves. The best thing you can do is report their accounts and hope that one day they realise that their online actions will have real consequences.","Score":16,"Total_comments":0}

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"mb1elz","Title":"Being bullied off of social media after unfollowing one friend","Author":"bulliedthrowawayyyy","Timestamp":1616457060000,"Text":"\nTrigger Warning: suicide \n\n\nGreetings. The title pretty much says it all but here\u2019s the longer version. I depend on social media to make some money to help at home, even thought my life at home hasn\u2019t been the best. and I\u2019ve been bullied by a group of shitposters that I thought I was friends with for the past couple of weeks without knowing why. \n\nAt first I thought I was finally part of a group of people who liked me, but suddenly they started to turn their back and then all at once, one night, they left. A lot of them blocked. No reasons given. \n\nDuring these weeks I received a message from different people telling me that they know people were taking behind me. I didn\u2019t know what it was until I received screenshots of people laughing at my mental health issues, insecurities, appearance, etc. and the reason this all started was because earlier this month I decided to take a break and unfollowed one person that didn\u2019t take it lightly and went to complain in that discord server and all hell broke lose from there. \n\nWhat hurts me the most is that I cared about this person like family. We even discussed the situation via messaging. But at the same day they asked for some time to think things about, they went to that community and they started the psychological tormenting me. I am still sick to my stomach and this is going to be another week I can\u2019t do anything online out of fear. \n\nWhen I received the screenshots, I publicized because I finally had proof of what was happening, but nobody heard me. They all blocked me so who would have seen it? So I tagged some people with bigger following asking for help because this group hover over them for clout. In a couple of hours the main culprits released apologies, but one of them went in my messages and harassed me, demanding to delete the posts and not involve anyone else, to be the bigger person. \n\nThis person was going NUTS demanding me to delete the name of the influencers, even calling me the R word and an idiot and other insults. I kept the DM\u2019s, but I\u2019m afraid of publicizing because, like me, this person also have mental issues with depression and Autism, so I\u2019m not ok with it, but I can\u2019t call him out. \n\nAll of this was also consequence because there was also sexting between me and the leader of the pack and after that they pretty much started to ignore my existence in that discord, I never felt so unwelcome even though I helped the server, I even paid boosts to let them have emotes. I\u2019m tired that I can\u2019t defend myself anymore and of losing friends, so I logged off social media, but still, I can\u2019t make any penny now. I\u2019m hurt. \n\nSo guys, how should I proceed? This really had an effect in my mental health, so I\u2019m away of that specific site, there\u2019s a lot more in that story and is still currently happening, although I am away from that site and I\u2019m afraid if I post even just a pic they will still attack me. \n\nI told to the harasser that I will stand on my ground and won\u2019t delete anything, and that I do not accept their apology because I am being coerced. Am I doing wrong? Their apology was not sincere, you can just tell because of this demand afraid of some bigger account to catch up with it. \n\nI\u2019m staying away from that web site although my business is suffering. I have my faults, I admit that. I have diagnosed PTSD from abuse,su!cide ideation and depression. When I unfollowed these people I attempted suicide(I\u2019m in therapy, please don\u2019t worry, right now is hard but I\u2019m working as hard as I can). \n\nI guess I just needed to vent in a place nobody knows who I am and who are those involved. I just want to be heard without judgement. Thank you for your time. Thank you for reading this. I\u2019m not in that website for quite some time. I need to figure out other ways of revenue.","Score":1,"Total_comments":2}

I mean nothing should prevent you from staying off social media, if you're a mentally stable person.\n\nBtw. I'm talking only about cyber bullying and not \"real\" bullying. I  see, that it can be actually hard to escape \"real\" bullying .\"\n\ni won't reveal the name of who said this to me, but i want to make sure people understand that it doesn't matter if it's in person or online, bullying is bullying. in fact, cyberbullying can be way worse than in-person bullying because of the fact that the predators hide behind a computer screen, and there's not much you can do to stop it despite it being illegal.\n\nalso, it's not just people with mental problems who commit suicide. there are also mental disabilities that can develop in a \"healthy\" person as a result of bullying, such as PTSD, and no one can control that it happens. you can't blame people for having mental illnesses, that's ableism logic, and you also can't say that everyone who has ever killed themselves already had mental health problems. you don't have to be mentally ill to feel emotions.\n\nthis way of thinking is incredibly harmful and does not allow society to progress. suicide is a joke for many people, and for others, it's something they actively encourage. just a few weeks ago on twitter, someone told me to take some poison. i reported them for suicide encouragement, and action was taken, but it was not the first time someone has told me to kill myself, and i'm certain many of you on this sub have had the same things happen to you. for those of us who battle crippling emotion and suicidal thoughts, we are strong, but we are still vulnerable. unless you are an actual psychopath (not an insult, but actually being born as one), you have feelings, and you are susceptible to being mentally damaged by ALL kinds of bullying.\n\nnot only that, but mental damage can lead to physical damage. did you know that emotional and mental stress can have significant effects on your body and shorten your life? also, people handle trauma differently based on how their brain responds. remember that the brain is a powerful machine that we don't fully understand, we can only use a percentage of it at a time, and we CANNOT CONTROL how it functions. i'll give a personal experience of mine:\n\n many years ago, my friend and i got in a car crash. now i'm more afraid  of cars, and i actually freak out if, when i'm riding in a car, there  are other cars close to ours. i also have nightmares about the crash.  however, my friend can still drive her car and is more confident and  careful about driving, especially with other cars around. she does not  get nightmares. you can't judge someone by what happens to their brains  when experiencing trauma, because it's out of our control. it's called  PTSD, and if we could control it, i'd have WAAAAAAAAAY less problems and  WAAAAAAAAAAY less nightmares.\n\ni had to tell this to another ableist. i know for certain many of you and others out in the world relate to this, especially PTSD victims. it happens with big things too; one rape victim could be traumatized, but filled with confidence to keep on living their life as best they can, be positive, and not let that experience get them down. another rape victim could be traumatized, have trouble leaving the house, will be afraid of sex, and eventually end up killing themselves. does it mean the second person overreacted? absolutely not. ABSOLUTELY NOT.\n\nif we want society to stop making suicide and mental illness out to be a joke, we need to educate people like this and help them understand the severity of all of these kinds of situations, how our brains cope, and that we're not all the same. how about, instead of making others feel like shit for things they have no control over, empathize and understand them. my husband has NEVER been through the stuff i have, and he is mentally sound in every way. however, he 100% understands how we work, what our brains do, and the limitations we have when it comes to dealing with pain.\n\ndo you really want to wait until something happens to YOU to give YOU PTSD to understand?","Score":3,"Total_comments":4}

Originally I thought I was the first and only victim thrust I didn't say anything instead I just ignored her. After reading what this other person put I realised just how bad my bully could get and realised no matter what she wouldn't stop and it would only get worse.\n\nThe person who bullied me has gone by a range of different names. StarlessAndAngelus, Sameen Root Reese, Rachael Reese, McKenzie's Rules, Louise The Nightmare Reese, Real Roman Reigns, Sam Root Reese, LA Crew, Lady Dark Angel, Cerri Louise Strahm, Lady of Death - Lady Blood Angel, Lady of Death 29, Dempsey's Rules, Nikolai Balinski, John Ryan Reese, John Reese 4 Rachel Reese, Calgar 2020 and Judgement Day War.\n\nThis person has bullied people on a range of different sites. [Stardoll.com](https:\/\/Stardoll.com)  (where she got me), [Fanfiction.net](https:\/\/Fanfiction.net), [Wattpad.com](https:\/\/Wattpad.com), [Quotev.com](https:\/\/Quotev.com), [ArchiveOfOurOwn.org](https:\/\/ArchiveOfOurOwn.org) and [DeviantArt.com](https:\/\/DeviantArt.com)\n\nEach time its with the same accusations. She will pretend to be nice. But then suddenly turn nasty when something doesn't go her way or when she's confronted about something. She purposely starts arguments with other people. Yet through all this is claims to be an adult. My bully is known to target teenagers and those with mental health problems. Even her own family have been targeted by her behaviour. Mainly her younger sister.\n\nEvery time she bullies she will use the socket puppet accounts. There is at least two on quotev, between 9 - 11 on Fanfiction, at least five on wattpad, was around 2-3 on DeviantArt (most have been deleted) and at least three accounts on AO3. She uses these accounts to initiate the bullying all while saying they are her friends and she didn't know what they were doing. She will defend the actions of these accounts and always make up excuses for what they have done even when these accounts have bullied other people.\n\nShe normally says the accounts are friends. Normally famous people (actors) or characters from her favourite films\/tv shows\/video games. The accounts will say you bullied her and continue on with the bullying, they will ask questions and then ignore all answers unless its what they want to hear. My bully the main one. StarlessAndAngelus. She says she knows nothing off it but will defend the account and know things that only happened on certain accounts.\n\nThe bullying normally consists of reporting stories StarlessAndAngelus wants to have or is jealous of, reporting stories, claiming an O.C was hers, claiming the story was written about her or has aspects of her life,  Saying she was the original creator of the stories, saying you bullied her, accusing you of hurting someone she knows, she has been known to get work removed or bluntly ripping it off, she sends nasty messages from a verity of accounts and follows you across all sites she's on. She will also report social media accounts, plagiarise published works by known authors and claim it as her own. And Steal the likeness of those she has bullied. She sends horrible comments for story receives and threatening messages to those who she bullies.\n\nShe comes up with a variety of excuses when confronted. The main one being it wasn't her but one of her friends. She has claimed to have mental health problems or to be in a mental health ward. She also blames her childhood and parents for her actions. She will never take responsibility for what she's done even when confronted with evidence to debunk other things she said.\n\nStarlessAndAngelus is in her 30's and bullying people half her age while claiming she's the world greatest written. I didn't think it could get any worse until I found out she uses the death of the late Paul Walker (R.I.P) as an excuses for her actions. She ropes innocent people (celebrities) into it. To make matters worse I also found out she also bullied a seventeen year old girl to suicide. Still she has not owned up to it but instead she blames other people for it. She's said the older sister of that girl is to blame, told the mother of that girl she was a terrible mother and that the girl deserved to die. (mother died in 2020 of Covid).\n\nI know this is probably wrong. But I believe people have the right to know about this woman and what she does and has done. I believe people should know of this predator (through lack of better words) whom roams the internet looking for people to bully and hurt.\n\nThese are her links [Wattpad](https:\/\/www.wattpad.com\/user\/StarlessandAngelus) \\- [Fanfiction](https:\/\/www.fanfiction.net\/u\/14163996\/Starless-and-Angelus) \\- [Quotev](https:\/\/www.quotev.com\/Rachelzoereese)\\-[AO3](https:\/\/archiveofourown.org\/users\/StarlessandAngelus\/pseuds\/StarlessandAngelus) (only her main ones).

Cyberbullies often gaslight me and try to claim that \"I started the problem.\"  I've been called controlling, a sock puppet, and some other stuff by randos online after telling them to stop.  After looking up videos on the channels that target me (and seeing videos that are on the channel and star one person, which is usually who owns the channel presumably), the type of people tend to vary: one had videos of anime song covers and a young-looking person hanging out with their friend, so I presumed that it was a high schooler.  Another one had a ton of conspiracy videos being told aloud by an old lady claiming to be a psychic and an \"empath\".  It's weird because a regular bully usually has the stereotype of being a stocky, buff teen while a cyberbully could be literally anyone.  There are plenty of stories of people being seemingly normal and friendly in person but living double lives just to harass people online for whatever reason- here are a few examples:\n\nThis 50-year-old woman used deepfakes to cyberbully the underage kids on her daughter's cheerleading squad:\n\n[https:\/\/nbc-2.com\/news\/2021\/03\/15\/cheer-squad-mom-accused-of-cyberbullying-minors-with-deepfakes\/](https:\/\/nbc-2.com\/news\/2021\/03\/15\/cheer-squad-mom-accused-of-cyberbullying-minors-with-deepfakes\/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis teen ended her life after one of her mom's friends cyberbullied her to suicide:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Suicide\\_of\\_Megan\\_Meier](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Suicide_of_Megan_Meier)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's surprising how many people act like they can use their online persona as a mask and pretend to be weak and dainty.  Everyone acts like they can hide behind the glass and sooner or later a community is destroyed by one person acting as a cavity in a clean mouth.  The truth is, you're very brave for coming forward with what this person has done to you and we will try to be there for you regardless of what this person says about you.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

Apologies for any formatting issues.*\n\nSo a bit of a backstory about myself: I (20F) am very much a writer. I love to write stories, always have for as long as I can remember, but have written some poems for fun as well\u2014never really for the purpose of sharing, just for the fun of doing it. Writing stories is my go-to way of venting and also really helps if I'm stressed about something. So some time ago my aunt introduced me to a website called AllPoetry, which has kind of a \"sister site\" called StoryWrite.\n\nI submitted some stories to StoryWrite and some poems to AllPoetry for feedback. I got some really amazing comments on all of them and everything was fine for a while. Not too long ago commented on another writer's poem to give my input on their writing and suggested using a bit of punctuation to help the reading of it flow a little easier\u2014doesn't seem like much of a problem, right?\n\nA few hours later I received some really nasty words back from that person about my own poetry, which I wasn't initially upset about because it's their opinion as to whether they like it or not\u2014but then the person said some really mean things about my appearance and my profile picture on the site, which is me as a four-year-old.\n\nI blocked this person shortly after receiving these messages, but when I filed a report with the site administration they informed me that they could not remove the person from the site or prevent access. I don't think it will happen, or can, but I still worry a bit about whether or not this person could somehow contact me some other way.\n\nThis is the poem they commented some negative things on the site about: [https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1m7tyTs\\_lwWAAXN17WrJl5DxGnq9m1FnIQy60xJ7O0To\/edit?usp=sharing](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1m7tyTs_lwWAAXN17WrJl5DxGnq9m1FnIQy60xJ7O0To\/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nHere is a screenshot of the kind-of \"ending\" of the conversation that passed. You can see my profile picture next to the paragraphs. The second and fourth \"paragraphs\" are the other person and the first and third were written by my friend (the first is in my perspective, because I have extreme issues standing up for myself and was scared to write something myself, and the other is in her own words trying to defend me).\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g1aytcug14j51.jpg?width=2176&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=43169c08b235c4695d1828d0b96d99537cffc939\n\nThe last line in particular really upset me to the point that I can't go onto the website anymore and can't even write anymore\u2014AT ALL\u2014because every time I open either my notes on my phone or a notebook I only think of that line and it just really puts me off doing it because I'm scared if I share something again it will happen again.\n\nAm I just being paranoid about nothing? Advice strongly appreciated, as well as some input on my work. (It might not help the situation, but it would really make me feel better about what I love to do) ****Please help this get upvoted, I really need to get this off my chest...","Score":3,"Total_comments":11}

My advice would be to pull their ip and shock them with it, or even use it to track their location and give it to the police. The best way to pull an ip is to get into a voice call with them (discord doesn't work because it rerouts the packets through a pingbot) and use a packet sniffer such as Wireshark or LANC to pull their ip address. If they're using a VPN, the fake ip address constantly pings the real ip address. All you have to do is see which ip they're pinging the most.

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"lkh535","Title":"Would you consider this cyberbullying?","Author":"Indigo_132","Timestamp":1613406628000,"Text":"Hi. I\u2019m a 16 year old male. I\u2019m an electronic music producer. I\u2019d say that my music is pretty good right now. However, back in 2016 and 2017, when I was 12 and 13, my music was very bad, and people picked on me and made fun of me for it. I\u2019ve been wondering for a long time now whether or not my situation would have been considered cyberbullying, so I\u2019ve decided to ask you guys what you think.\n\nBasically, in late 2016, I was making pretty bad music, and I was only 12. I didn\u2019t realize that it was bad, but it was. I didn\u2019t know anything about key signatures, so the melodies were disastrous. However, I didn\u2019t hear that and I had a lot of motivation to make music. My music name was (and still is) Indigo 132. Around that time, I saw a YouTube channel comment on one of my songs called \u201cPurple 132.\u201c They claimed to be a 6 year old that was a fan of my music, and made really bad music inspired by my music. I believed them, because I was only 12 and pretty innocent at the time. Later, more channels like Red 132, Green 132, Orange 132, among others popped up, all claiming to be little kids that were fans of mine. As time went on, I began to realize that these were not little kids. They were people intending to make fun of my music, and they frequently engaged me in conversations, tricking me into believing they were my fans. Many other more professional music producers who I kind of knew online starting going along with it and getting in on the joke, tricking me into believing that these channels were real fans of mine.\n\nIn 2017, people started saying that they didn\u2019t even believe that I was a real person anymore because my music was so consistently bad and I wasn\u2019t improving. I\u2019m a highly sensitive person, and I don\u2019t think people understood how much this hurt me. Sometimes, when I was just randomly getting involved in YouTube discussions about EDM songs, people would see my username and jokingly say something like, \u201cOh, look, it\u2019s Indigo 132, our Lord and Savior!\u201d One time, I commented on someone\u2019s video, and they hearted my comment and said that they\u2019d heart all of my comments to show people that \u201cThe one and only Indigo 132\u201c had subscribed to them.\n\nIn early 2018, someone jokingly made a terrible song and posted it, crediting me as the artist, even though I didn\u2019t make the song, and by then my music was starting to become pretty decent. Someone in the comments of that video said, \u201cDid Indigo 132 actually make this?\u201d Someone else replied, \u201cHe did.\u201d I then replied, in the most Matter-of-fact way I could, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d Then the bully who replied \u201cHe did\u201d replied to me saying, \u201cOh s\\*\\*\\*, scatter! Also, hello, my lord.\u201d Or something like that. It was just really messy, and I hate to think about it now.\n\nNow that my music has been better for a long time, people rarely pick on me now. I have some actual real fans, which feels amazing. But still, about once a year or so, people will see me in the YouTube comments and jokingly say something like, \u201cOh it\u2019s the one and only Indigo 132, our lord and savior,\u201d or something like that.\n\nDoes this sound like cyberbullying to you guys? Thanks so much for reading my long post, and I appreciate and guidance you guys can provide. :)","Score":4,"Total_comments":10}

They calling me names, getting tease, getting hit, getting push, and others. Some of the bullies are white, black, Hispanics and other races. I hate bullies, you hate bullies, nobody likes bullies. And even worst, the cyberbullies. Couple months ago, I was in some Watchmojo.com videos. Because you know, the best top 10 videos on the internet. I was putting on the comment section to put \u201cCan you put Top 10 toxic anime communities\u201d because you know, I\u2019m a anime fanboy who like anime sometime. Don\u2019t you say the \u201cW\u201d word I hate it so much. I\u2019ll see you in the comment section after this. I was leave it there for a hour or couple of days. I was got multiple notifications on my phone because I bet it\u2019s was the others anime fans saying which anime community is the most toxic. I open up, and then this happened. A username is mymmtmumutmyumy and profile picture is m with the the green background. Maybe it\u2019s a default profile picture. I never seen this guy is typing angry stuff of me. I decide to ignore it. Couple days later when I keep spamming the same question over and again in every top 10 anime videos. I got a notification on YouTube. I open the app and he say \u201cShut up, kid\u201d \u201cNobody cares about you\u201d \u201cPathetic immature child.\u201d I was I like, I\u2019m not a child I\u2019m an adult. I\u2019m 20 years old. You can\u2019t called a 20 years old person a child. You\u2019re over 18. That\u2019s it. This guy is keep spamming the same thing over and over again. I reported him, and he\u2019s gone. I think his account was terminated. Few months later, everything feel normal. And then, I got notifications on YouTube. I open the YouTube app and I see the same sentence say \u201cPathetic immature child.\u201d I recognize it and I was shocked! He created a new account. His username is Luciano Rojas. And he keep spamming over and over and over saying \u201cshut up, kid\u201d \u201cnobody cares about you\u201d \u201cPathetic immature child\u201d \u201cYou ruined everything\u201d \u201cLeave this channel.\u201d And even the worst part, he say \u201cI will never leave you alone.\u201d This is sound abuse! And this guy just won\u2019t stop! I blocked him, I keep reporting him, but YouTube do nothing, and even worst, they terminated my YouTube account! How they terminated my account because they think I was being rude all the time. I told him to \u201cFuck off\u201d \u201cLeave the fuck alone\u201d \u201cFuck you\u201d and \u201cshut the fuck up and leave me alone.\u201d Look like they reviewed my comments of how I saying bad things. So I created new account and everything normal on Watchmojo video. But then. This is the same guy. That\u2019s right. The same username is Luciano Rojas. He just recognized my name. I blocked him, and keep reporting this guy but YouTube do nothing and he keep using the same thing like \u201cshut up, kid\u201d \u201cnobody cares about you\u201d \u201cPathetic immature child\u201d \u201cYou ruined everything\u201d and \u201cLeave this channel.\u201d I told him to leave me alone and he say \u201cI will never leave you alone.\u201d This is so fucking horrifying when some hackers are trying to tracking you down and threaten your life. I feel like I was being targeted. And he even worst, he know my me on Instagram and PicsArt. He said \u201cI found you in Pinterest.\u201d I thought he was joking but he actually found me said \u201cI found you in PicsArt\u201d He said \u201cI found the photo of your face.\u201d I told him to \u201cfuck off,\u201d \u201cleave me alone\u201d and told him to stop. Couple of weeks later, I create new account to put some random at Watchmojo video on YouTube, but he really found me again. And he put my old picture of teenage of me on his profile picture and his username is \u201cI\u2019m a ugly pathetic immature child.\u201d Like what the fuck?! That\u2019s sound humiliating! How did he get my old picture?! That\u2019s called invasion of privacy! \n\n\n\n[This is the same cyberbully. Tap\/click here. He got my old photo of me](https:\/\/youtube.com\/channel\/UCxBjoExQDWo_rkUq0owuYFw)\n\nThis is the same cyberbully. He used my old picture of teenage myself to do drawing in high school project. Please report this to the police please. \n\nUpdate: This user is changing his names and profile picture! This is the same guy! \n\n\nAnd then he found my IP address but, he didn\u2019t know what my IP address is! Maybe he was joking to scare me. He told me to leave \u201cYou can post something on PicsArt and Instagram, but you will leave YouTube forever! And never put anything in your comment.\u201d Like what the fuck is this bullshit?! He like a fucking dictator of the comment section. Watchmojo isn\u2019t yours, it\u2019s theirs! My Instagram is in privacy and I remove link account, my posts are in hide. I would like to report this to the police but we\u2019re in pandemic. I\u2019m tired of this fucking guy who need to stop bothering me! I wish PicsArt need to put in private mode. I wish this guy will just leave me alone. He was going to ruined the works. My fan arts, my videos and more. This guy is fucking predator. I never seen a guy who tracking me down. He use his other account. His other account username is Renee Rojas. Maybe he use his fake name. And this guy just won\u2019t leave me alone. I want to report to the police to identify him but we\u2019re in pandemic. Sure you\u2019re gonna ask the police officer but I\u2019m afraid they won\u2019t believe me. My older sister see me I was being upset and look at my story on Instagram and she \u201cYou had to ignore it\u201d but I like how?! This guy is just keep spamming and calling me names over and over again! But cyberbully is a serious problem. Don\u2019t just stand there, screenshot the things that you have evidences and report to the police if something serious. Don\u2019t just there, just resist it and find help.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit 1\nFeb. 7, 2021 \n\nThis guy need to stop! He found he everywhere! He found me on PicsArt, Instagram where I left it in description in PicsArt, Reddit, different YouTube video, and Twitter?! HOW THE FUCK DID THIS FUCKER FOUND ME?! THIS GUY NEED A SERIOUS HELP!! HE SHOULD GO TO PRISON!!! \n\nHey, asshole! If you\u2019re reading this, all my accounts in different media are privates! So fuck off or I\u2019ll report it to the police!

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"l7n7g5","Title":"Can\u2019t tell if this is cyber bullying coupled with sexual coercion","Author":"atly87","Timestamp":1611907977000,"Text":"Sorry, long post. I (33F) recently had a weird, traumatizing experience with a former friend (32M) that left me wondering if I was cyber bullied or sexually coerced. \n\nA little backstory. My former friend and I met during our freshman year of college, and we had been close friends for 10 years. There had been a few times during our 10-year friendship where we would profess our mutual attraction towards each other and gotten \u201cclose,\u201d even though we\u2019ve never been physically intimate with one another. All of our \u201cintimate\u201d moments happened via text in the form of sexting. But no sex. But, we\u2019ve always been able to bounce back and be just friends. And it\u2019s the platonic aspect of our friendship that I cherish and miss the most.\n\nTwo years ago, he got engaged to a woman whom he had dated for only 8 months by that time. My now husband and I met up with them for dinner one night and she was extremely rude to both my husband and I. Wouldn\u2019t engage with us, wouldn\u2019t answer \u201cgetting to know you\u201d type of questions, wouldn\u2019t make eye contact. She pretty much ignored us the entire time and appeared as though she would rather not associate with us at all. But I gave her the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to shyness or social anxiety, and I tried to be empathetic. Tried to connect, wishing her happy birthday and liking her posts on Instagram, making her feel welcome, etc. Fast forward six months, and my friend randomly decided to cut contact with both my husband and myself without explanation. Blocked both of us on everything you can think of. Being that we\u2019ve been friends for a decade prior to the cut off, I was devastated and wanted to know why. He said he felt our friendship had no place in our current relationships, even though we were all cool with each other before. \n\nA few weeks ago, I got into contact with my friend\u2019s mom and we talked for a little bit. I asked her how my friend is doing. She told me that my friend and his now wife (the woman mentioned above) had been estranged from the family for close to two years now, but that she would be happy to text him and let him know that I\u2019ve been trying to reach him and reconnect. I told her ok. So she texted him, acknowledging that he might not even respond to her but hoped that he would at least respond to me. I honestly didn\u2019t think that I would hear back, but I figured I might give it a shot. \n\nA few days after, I received a text from a number that I didn\u2019t recognize, asking if I am (insert name here). When I asked who it was I was speaking to, the person texted back and claimed to be my friend. Excited as I was to hear from him, I asked him how he\u2019s doing and apologized to him for whatever I thought I had done for him to abruptly sever a 10 year friendship like he did. We casually talked for a bit. And then he started steering the conversation into \u201cuncomfortable\u201d territory by asking me sexual questions. When I told him that I don\u2019t welcome that type of communication and asked him to respect my marriage, he got angry and told me to go my separate way if we can\u2019t \u201cbe more than friends.\u201d\n\nSince I missed him so much, I didn\u2019t want to go my separate ways without closure or at least a discussion about what happened. I continued with the conversation, when looking back, I should have stopped. While I asked him questions that any concerned friend would have asked him in that moment (aka, are you okay? Why are you doing this? You don\u2019t sound like yourself, etc), he kept bringing up steamy memories from our past that ultimately brought me to my knees in surrender. He hit all the right emotional and primal spots until, despite my best efforts, I eventually caved in and gave him what he wanted. I stupidly sent him photos that he asked for. Stupid, I know. \n\n\nAfter that happened, I spent the next few days, feeling disgusted, coerced, and sexually violated in some way. Something in my gut didn\u2019t feel right about the situation, from the tone of my friend\u2019s text (which sounded out of character) to the forcefulness of his requests for photos to the complete silence after my photos were sent. I texted his mom and let him know about the weirdness of our conversation, without giving any explicit details, and asked if the number that I received the texts from were really his. She confirmed that it wasn\u2019t. Horrified, I asked if it was his wife\u2019s number. She confirmed that it was.\n\nI felt so horrified, nauseous, betrayed, and angry that I texted my friend\u2019s wife and told her that what she did was cruel, manipulative, and potentially criminal. Pretending to be my friend, texted as though she was him, and then coerced me into sending nude photos. She lashed out at me and said \u201cYou\u2019re too easy. I\u2019m sure your husband would love to have screenshots of our conversation.\u201d And then proceeded to tell me that I was in no way coerced, that I consented, and that I need to drop the allegations of coercion or she would blackmail me to my husband. She not only invalidated my feelings when I told her that I felt violated in some way, she smeared my character by calling me a \u201ccheater.\u201d To make matters worse, she told me that my friend was behind all of this deception. Then she had him text me to explain why he did what he did. His reason? Because I had no right to ask his mom about him and that I had no right to want to reconnect. Then told me to never contact him again. \n\nI told my husband all this, and he\u2019s been so understanding and so supportive. And he\u2019s very upset with my (now) former friend and his wife for doing this. He\u2019s upset about the photos, and expressed that he wished I never did what I did. But we ended up working out our issues and he forgave me. I still feel like I\u2019ve been sexually coerced, or at the very least cyber bullied. I will be seeing my therapist on February 16th, but I just can\u2019t wait that long and the anxiety about what happened is killing me.","Score":1,"Total_comments":9}

I have to wonder why these sh#t stirrers are let back on the platform to incite hatred. This girl literally knew nothing about me, or the situation I was dealing with and attempted to scare me into submission by making threats if I didn\u2019t leave her buddies alone. It was the most juvenile experience i have ever dealt with, but whatever she says. My fear is that no one will be able to talk anymore because you\u2019ve got people taking over a public livestreaming site. It\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re being silenced because someone in a clique dislikes you or many people. You have the right to dislike someone but you don\u2019t have the right to silence them by fear.","Score":7,"Total_comments":1}

The issue I have is that a middle aged female decided to find my 2 year old reddit account and lead tons of people from our site to this bogus reddit account. The account did have some truth to it, and never did I think anyone would seek it out, because why would they? This woman was trying to discredit the things I was livestreaming  by pointing out the old reddit and saying \u201c see, she\u2019s a liar\u201d. I admitted to the community that the old reddit was satirical and that two people used the account. It wasn\u2019t this woman\u2019s business to incite hatred and this is why I won\u2019t livestream until I find a community that isn\u2019t obsessed with hurting people in real life. I received threats through text messages and we had our devices compromised\/ hacked. I had a girl come at me the other night for no real reason. I had never insulted her but she inadvertently insulted my dead mother and called me the C word numerous times, while screaming and insisting that I had to be a liar because she read the two year old reddit and believed people on the site who knew me oh so well. She also made it clear that she and her close friends could trash anyone they wanted but her friends were off limits. \n   The truth is, I shared with very few people on that site because i saw a trend of middle aged females getting angrier and angrier over stupid sh#t and then bashing people just for fun. I also didn\u2019t enjoy people thinking it was appropriate to look into people\u2019s real lives, or call places of employment, or call CPS or people\u2019s families. There is a site that talks about how people don\u2019t stand up for others because it\u2019s easier to back someone who is cyber bullying because they desire power and control over a situation. They will often overtly threaten you until leaving is your only option. People wonder why we lose our ability to speak freely?  Yeah, soon freedom of speech will be controlled because of this behavior. Well, these are the bullies that will text you things like \u201c if you don\u2019t stop talking about my friend, I will come after you.\u201d You have to ask yourself is a social media site worth your real life safety? You have to ask yourself if you enjoy watching others being hurt. I decided to focus on the things that really mattered to me and it wasn\u2019t the opinions of weirdo\u2019s who monopolize social media sites to the point where your voice or opinion must be silenced. This is how we will lose our ability to speak out against people threatening to harm us or our families. I was given resources after talking about the fact that the abuse coming from this platform could easily lead someone who isn\u2019t well to self harm, kill themselves, or be so triggered that they needed a lot of help.","Score":5,"Total_comments":4}

This happened to me when a middle aged female decided to go after me during a live stream and talk about blood stains on a mattress. My mom suffered through three coma\u2019s and died after the third. She had bed sores and they bled. This woman thought it was hilarious to bring this up in front of hundreds of individuals. The bed was in a room that was being painted and we hadn\u2019t removed the bed yet. It\u2019s never ok to assume you know someone\u2019s circumstances. After she ripped me apart over my home , saying it was filthy, she started screaming the C word at the top of her lungs. I was stunned because I barely know this woman and have never insulted her in my life. I saw the same thing that happened to me, happen to other individuals on this platform on a nightly basis. If you come across a forum or platform where people follow a herd mentality and won\u2019t call someone out for inappropriate behavior, you should leave and never look back. Did I get support through this platform, yes, but it was not worth what happened to me due to a certain person\u2019s need to air my dirty laundry. Please say something if you think certain words are abusive or behavior. If someone begins to scream and cannot control their ability to stop screeching and screaming, you\u2019re in a toxic environment and you should leave. I would also suggest finding groups that have rules and regulations. You should not be able to \u201c out people \u201c for any reason. If you receive threats that if you don\u2019t say the right thing or remove something, harm will befall you, get out. No one has the right to be controlling. Obviously everyone has the right to speak on a public platform but when it becomes hate speech there\u2019s an issue. On one hand you don\u2019t want to censor, but on the other hand there\u2019s totally unacceptable behavior that I have witnessed that would cause a lot of unstable individuals to self harm. I think people need to realize that the people behind the voice and faces and keyboards are human beings and that we all have feelings. Take my advice and only share personal details with individuals you trust. It can be difficult to find trustworthy individuals so build a rapport before sharing very personal details. I refuse to ever join a platform like the one I was using because honestly I don\u2019t want to watch people being ripped apart, or endure feeling like my past should be everyone\u2019s business. When people cyberbully, they will often insert themselves into your life, when really they should be focused on their own lives and not the past behaviors or actions of others. I cannot stress enough that cyberbullying can be horrific for your mental health and to deactivate your account if it becomes too much. There\u2019s nothing wrong with stepping away from a toxic platform and enjoying \u201c in person friendships\u201d, or finding a forum that is the right fit for you.

Just me, my feelings and what I did because of them. You do not have to agree with everything that is written here, but please don't judge me. Thanks. (Sorry if there are mistakes here, it's long and I have no power to the rules of grammar).**\n\nIt all started in 2016, I signed up for a game online without knowing where it would lead me. It happened pretty fast, I had friends and I became very popular on the site. With the friends came rivalries as well. I was pretty small then, I did not know that what I was doing, even the smallest thing, could hurt people so much. It started to be my gimmick, the little revenge on the actresses who criticized me, called me a devil and said there are girls who will do whatever I tell them.\n\nIn my real life I was a quiet girl, a bookworm, one who would never hurt anyone. And in this game ... it was interesting, to see what happens when you know me as a different character. There is magic in this anonymity, and I was carried away. Sounds like a school story, doesn't it? So this is only the beginning.\n\nOne of my more serious fights on the site was with some kids a little more ... \"dark\". Depressions , with piercings and tattoos and death lovers. One of them once put social pressure on someone who was a good friend of mine to have me Break into a user. she broke, and after I returned the user it retired from the site. (It was at September 2018).\n\nSince then he and I have been in a constant quarrel. At one point I found out I could break into him, but I held back. He quarreled with me time and time again and the things he wrote became more and more violent, like \"If I could I would kill her, but unlike her I am a law-abiding citizen.\" And \"I would give up my life to ruin hers.\" But one day he literally gasps. He said that if he had my voodoo doll he would wait for me to go to school, undress me and stab me with knives . I could not keep quiet about such a thing, I broke into it and deleted something from the user, something that was shared by him and his friends. (And that was in May 2019).\n\nShe was fine with everyone, I never saw her fight or swear. She was a year older than me and made the impression of someone mature and intelligent.\n\nAnd even with that child she was fine. He told her it was me who broke in, at first she did not believe him. So she asked me. I did not want to lie. But especially didn't want to lie to her. So I told her the truth. I remember that day, I remember where I was. I received 11 messages from her. In these messages she told me that she is also disappointed in me, but she also understands me. Something in the way she wrote it was really special. Finally someone sees that I am a real person beyond the screen. She was honest with me, didn't agree with everything I said but respected me. I knew she was special and wanted to get to know her better. And that day ... something in my heart started working.\n\nWe got very close to each other and a special bond was formed between us. We talked a lot and told each other personal things. I never opened up to someone like that, everything she wrote just made me realize how amazing she is. She always knew how to say the right thing at the right time, she had lots of smart sentences all the time. So I told her. I told her exactly how I feel, and that for me she is much more than just a friend from the internet. She wrote to me that she understands me, that she supports me. That she would be there to hold my hand. She told me she cared about me and I could trust her. And she will be there for me to support me. That day I told her we started talking on WhatsApp (and it stopped because her dad asked her what it was). We even arranged to meet once at an event in the city (we live in the same city) but she regretted it before.\n\nShe never really understood how deep my feelings for her were. (And speaking of sexual orientation, I think I can fall in love with any person. I don't fall in love with any gender, I love the personality.) I tried to tell her how much I love her, I wanted her to know that.\n\nAnd I wanted us to know each other better. So I started looking. I found out what school she attends. I remembered she once said her class number and timetable\n\nWas on the school website. I found a video she participated in on the school's Facebook page, and her name was written below. I knew it was because I recognized her from the profile picture on WhatsApp. And if that's not enough ... I knew I could get there, and I knew exactly how.\n\nFor a long time I thought about doing it, but it was a crazy idea. And very strange. And it was confusing, on the one hand 'JUST DO IT' and 'follow your dreams', and on the other hand privacy.\n\nMy biggest dream was to see her. I wanted to know who appears in my dreams, who changed my world like that. About whom I can't stop thinking and drawing around her name hearts in my notebook.\n\nI thought I would have a few more years to do it, but I had a feeling I needed to hurry. That it is now or never. Only then did I realize why I felt that way, because of the corona. If I had decided to go there a month later it would no longer be for what.\n\nSo one day I just did it. I waited for her outside the school and followed her, from the exit to the bus station. I didn't touch her. I was just looking. I never wanted to hurt her. Just to know. At that moment I was in Cloud nine, it was euphoria. I made a dream come true.\n\nBut I was so preoccupied with my feelings that I didn't think about hers. I did not think what it would do to her.\n\nShe started to get stressed and walked away from me. I looked and she again sent me 11 messages, only this time they were different. She wanted me to leave her. I was really sad and didn't know what to answer.\n\nA month later I wrote her a lot of very long messages, that she was everything to me, that I was afraid of losing her and did not want to bother her. The last message I wrote to her was 'I love you'. She blocked me in response.\n\nI was broken, she was the most precious person in the world to me and I did not want to give her up. I would give anything to talk like we used to. I came from other users and tried to talk to her, in the end she got tired of me. One day I got to a public chat in a game and just wanted to play something, she was there. I asked if it was possible to join and she answered me, next to everyone who was there: \"I do not intend to talk to you anymore\". I felt so humiliated and left.\n\nThe next day she wrote in the same chat that I would stop sending her messages. I did not know there was such a pain. That the only thing I really want is something I can not get - she. I am not Material and I am not spoiled, but my heart wanted what it wanted. And she did not understand that these were my feelings.\n\nI could not give up, until she decided 'we will be friends again' just so I could calm down and be quiet. But the distance between us kept growing and it was no longer like it used to be. I felt she just wanted me to stay away.\n\nAbout the end of May 2020 she apologized for humiliating me. I was desperate; I so wanted to believe her. So I believed. Then it became clear to me that it was another attempt by her to get me to leave her.\n\nIn July 2020 I celebrated a birthday. I did not even get a \"happy birthday\" from her.\n\nNow another character enters the story. So that there is no confusion with the characters, I will give them nicknames.\n\nI will call the other character \"Stormy\", and the one I have told about so far will be \"Ice\". (Lol it's creative, right?).\n\nStormy and I are similar, but there is one big and significant difference between us. It works out of interests, I work from the heart.\n\nI care about everything too much, and Stormy only cares about herself. Stormy hated me quite a bit from the start, mostly because of what I once did. She resented me for a long time. And when she has a chance to bring me down, she does it. Just an example, she once posted a personal photo of me in a group of girls from the game.\n\nIcy and Stormy have been friends for quite some time, but when Icy and I moved away, Stormy saw an opportunity to quarrel between us even more. She clung to icy on purpose to tease me, and icy did not notice, she was very naive.\n\nWhenever Stormy suspected I was part of the site's support team, she thought I was somehow threatening her through the support (which was not true), she wrote my real name in the biggest chat. I reported it and the day after that it was blocked from the site, for two weeks. So she spread a lie about me being part of the support.\n\nIcy saw that Stormy was blocked and started arguing with me and saying it was my fault. (Am I to blame for spreading my name?? I am allowed to report, and the support decides what to do with it. Besides, it is very rare that someone is blocked one day after one report.) Icy told me that \"it is good for me to do harm to others\" and that I am no one for her . It hurt me a lot, it started to affect my self-criticism, I almost believed her. Everything she said was sacred to me, and it took me a long time to tell myself I was just as good as I was and she would not talk to me like that.\n\nStormy wrote me really disgusting things,  that 'I'm ugly' and 'I have an elephant's chin'. (It's important for me to make it clear that at least in my opinion, I am very beautiful in reality and love myself as I am. The fact that the camera does not think like me does not mean anything).\n\nicy saw all this, and chose to remain silent. I responded to Stormy and told her she was ugly on the inside. At that moment icy remembered to intervene, and she told me it was 'just a game' and I 'should relax'. I calmed down? No,  just the opposite. I told icy that if Stormy teases me she is silent, and if I say one thing she straight up remembers to respond. Stormy intervened and said it was because icy loved her and not me. Yes, she used the word 'loving'. And icy? Kept silent.\n\nAnd for the first time I felt I was not only sad because of her, but really, really, really angry. Not what Stormy said most upset me, I could deal with that. But icy's silence. She made me boil, I felt like I was all on fire.\n\nicy started to change, and I realized it was no longer the same one I loved and adored so much. She puts very unpleasant pictures as profile pictures, usually tumblers of girls with a phone and a very indifferent expression on their face. Her writing style has also changed, and instead of clever sentences in the profile she wrote things like \"Life is Beach\". She became two-faced and indecisive. She kept writing that she was \"retiring\" but in the end \"not retiring\". It all started to really annoy me. She was opaque and did not listen to me at all. She also started to be superficial, talking about piercings and eyebrow earrings. She also gave her password to someone who flirted with her and wrote to her that she was \"beautiful.\" (They quarreled because Stormy told icy to change a password, and she changed.)\n\nI wanted to check if icy has really changed that much. I sent her a message from another user without her knowing it was me. I pretended to be another friend of hers a long time ago who had already stopped playing. I then asked her if she could give me the password. I did not expect it to work so well, but it did not seem suspicious to her at all. She believed me and gave me her login details. I decided to take the opportunity and show her what it feels like to lose something so important. She broke my heart, I'll break into her user.\n\nIcy understood what had happened but it was too late. She could not speak for herself, and Stormy spoke for her. All I wanted was to talk to icy, I wanted to explain to her that I care about her. Stormy threatened me and wrote me shocking things. Some of the girls on the site put pressure on me, some supported me and understood me. Some tried to speak to my heart and some judged me. Stormy spread lies about me that I followed icy to her house and that I got her number without her knowledge. She also sent me WhatsApp messages to the phone number, I blocked her and she also threatened me via SMS. (It happened in mid-August).\n\nAfter a week I got tired of all this, and icy still didn't answer me. So I gave her the password back and they all left me alone. But I was so angry that I succumbed to the pressures, that I re-entered its user after a few days. I found out she managed to write that I was retarded and \"fucking psychopathic\". Then she retired from the game. (It was the end of August).\n\nAround October, the end of the year, a new year begins another moment and I wanted to open it cleanly. I wrote a message to icy that I'm really sorry, I also listed the reasons. Sorry for getting too close, for not respecting her privacy, for not leaving her when I had to leave, for taking something from her that belonged to her.\n\nThe whole post I did not write anything about it being wrong either. A few days later she answered me. She faked herself that \"everything is fine\" but in fact she just wanted her user back. I told her that I was also very hurt by her, and she said - \"Sorry about that, is that what anger does to people ha?\". I did not have the strength to argue with her about this answer and I just gave her the password. But later I started to get angry, what does it mean \"this is what anger does to people\"? If so then \"this is what love does to people\" and I am not at all to blame. Why should I cry, scream, regret and feel physical pain, when she blames her anger and takes no responsibility? It was her, not the anger. And that made me angry.\n\nA few days after that she sent a link in her profile. I went into it and saw that she had written the story in Reddit, but took down all the parts where she was wrong. She described me as psychic, crazy, insane. She said I abused her mentally and sexually. And I did not touch her. Never. She did not address my feelings at all and that I was human. I responded to her and she deleted the post.\n\nI tried to write to her about it, she did not respond to any of my message.\n\nI needed her and she was not there for me. But I'm most sorry I was not there for myself, that I doubted myself because of her. I was silent. It took me a long time to learn, and I am still learning, that I am just as good as I am.\n\nThis tragedy is painful, and it could not have happened either. But she gave me lots of life lessons. I promised myself that no matter what happens, I will stay who I am and will not change for anyone. Criticism will come one way or another, so it's better for me to be who I want to be.\n\nI think people judge too fast without looking at everything that happened. I wish we could be a little more considerate, more understanding and more loving. The world is not black and white, not good and bad. The choice is in our hands, how we choose to see the situation and what we choose to do.\n\nThank you so much for reading this, wish you the right choice. You guys are so amazing, be Yourself!","Score":1,"Total_comments":2}

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"kn379n","Title":"A sad tale (and a dire warning) about imgflip and its sole moderator who is a deranged and dangerous cyberbully","Author":"Unknown","Timestamp":1609338550000,"Text":"Before the report starts, here are some necessary facts about me:\n\nI'm from Germany, and English is not my native language. Also, I tend to be blunt when it is necessary since I have made the experience that drumming around the bush is most likely leading to heaps of BS. It's not about me whining about alleged unfair treatment (although D.W. has a knack for this). And, I'm a geezer (50+) who needs to get used to reddit. \ud83d\ude09\n\nFor the final reason why I am posting this, visit  [Your own personal Jesus - Imgflip](https:\/\/imgflip.com\/i\/4rl58u) . The sole mod of this site is giving away lots of informations about imgflip - and his own state of mind within this post. But you have to hurry, since I have the dim feeling that this post on imgflip won't be there for much longer...\n\nI had joined imgflip somewhere around the first major lockdown after finding out that there are 'discussion' streams. The 'politics' stream caught my attention immediately...especially when I had found out that this stream was\/is a cesspool of far-rights, conspiracy theorists\/terrorists, neofascists and folks who are plain nuts.\n\nLike \"*Timber1972*\". A master troll, a regular nutjob, a someone who is giving the term \"Don't go full retard\" a complete new meaning. And one of the few local 'celebs' on imgflip though for all the wrong reasons. Needless to mention that he had caught my attention, too. Needless to mention that we had some exchanges which left me with the sensation that this guy is seriously disturbed. Needless to mention that I had paid back in kind after being barraged with vile insults from the dirtiest sewer.\n\nAround Nov 2020, the drama was heading for its culmination with Timber seemimingly becoming more and more unhinged and many users becoming more and more fed up with this.  And then...the announcement that Timber was banned. imgflip rejoiced, including myself.\n\nFor me, the phase of joy was only shortlived because all of a sudden, someone hiding behind the username \\[deleted\\] accused me of being Timber. I had tried to get in touch with that user but no way since there was absolutely no profile available. \\[deleted\\] used almost the same diction Timber had used.  \nOkay, maybe Timber had found a way to circumvent the ban and is probably using some flaws in the software to his advantage. That's what I was thinking at this moment, and I had tried to get in touch with stream and community mods.\n\nEnter Dylan Wenzlau, self-proclaimed founder of imgflip. In the course of the \"exchanges\" which went from vile and unhinged insults by Wenzlau aka \\[deleted\\] over restricting my access to certain streams for completely fabricated reasons to finally revealing that it was him behind the attacks against me.  \n My suspicions about his mental deficiencies rose. And he made clear that he has no intention of stopping them (see the link above) although I had noticed him about the logic flaws in his line of arguments like the different patterns of expression, different IP etc.\n\nDylan remained unfazed. And came apart at the seams more and more while unintentionally revealing a lot of facts about imgflip.Like that he is the sole global moderator of imgflip and the \"community mods\" only being his creations. It helps living in a different time zone with noticing that during the time the common American sleeps or works there was almost no active moderation (i.e. featuring memes, responding to flags).Indirectly,  \nDylan had admitted of being Timber though you have to read very careful (one hint: both were boasting to make $200K per year though the sum varies from time to time) and also between the lines to detect his confession.\n\nAll in all, my personal opinion of Wenzlau is that he shouldn't be allowed to take part of any social media for his obvious mental deficiencies. I'm being sure that once Dylan thinks he's \"done\" with me he is going to pick the next victim to feed his obsessions.\n\n  \nIf I were a citizen of the US I would have him reported to the authorities long ago. All I could do is filing a restraining order via a German court which is likely to have no effect.  \nAll I can do is urging you of taking the threat Wenzlau is posing to vulnerable participants of imgflip serious enough to file reports to authorites (allegedly he's located in Santa Barbara, CA) and spread the stories about him and imgflip to whomever it may concern in the attempt of stopping him.","Score":4,"Total_comments":2}

This isn't really cyber bullying as it sounds to be much more similar to the beginning \"honeymoon stage\" of a stalker's mindset. Most of them start this way. In a non-threatening, no big deal, but irritating or frustrating enough for you to notice there's a problem being caused by one douche canoe to stand out from the rest. \n\nI'm not advertising or self promoting in any way, merely sharing insight that you may want to pursue asap, rather than shrugging it off and letting it become much more than a \"harmless game or hobby\" which is most likely how your new fan justifies their shitty behavior now. \n\nI happen to own a handful of companies that may be unrelated from a topic perspective, but all take advantage of my unique skillsets, by taking action to solve problems or neutralize tough situations or uncomfortable ones, covertly and immediately. In this particular case, one of those companies focuses only on clients who all have a stalker or some kind of situation like that going on. It's not about finding out simply who the stalker is and threatening them or doing anything silly, instead it revolves around understand who the target is, how long they have been doing it for, and many other important elements that have to do with their behavior and response to your or the client's behavior too. I could give a fuck what the \"why they do it\" response is. Simply put, there's not a good enough reason to justify that kind of behavior for more than a few hours outside of being upset, anything more than that, and it's just nonsense and noise. \n\nSo here's the deal. This sounds like it's too mild for anything I'd take on, client wise anyway, so I'll try to give you some quick tactical methods and all you have to do is stick to it, and don't do anything else. \n\nFirst and foremost, do not communicate with the person in any fashion. If you have before, stop immediately and do not continue. \nSecond, if you're in the US and they are in the UK, the police won't do much or anything, but you should still file a report nonetheless, as you never know how serious these things can get or not, after all, you're not the one behaving like a piece of shit, they are. So who knows what crazy crap they are justifying this for, or not. \nThird, take a break from social media in general for a week or two, so long as it doesn't hurt you, financially or screw with something important, anything that breaks routine behavior suddenly, without warning, will force someone like them to abandon their lil game after a few days of frustration. By the time you return, they will likely have lost interest and not really understand why, but they'll usually fuck off, without any issue. \n\nTry the above, and message me or chime in here afterwards and see how it plays out. It may be all you need to do. If this doesn't work, at least it won't encourage the person stalking you to amplify their being an annoying asshole initiative just yet, but it will at the very least show you that should it not work, they are much more of a threat than you are giving them credit for. Someone who doesn't lose interest after that, has a compulsion issue at the least, and should absolutely be handled in a rough way immediately, otherwise it will only get stranger and more sinister for you, when really, you could have dissolved it by simply nipping it in the bud and not letting them get control over your world. \n\nHope it works out for you. \n\nPS - if they are stalking you because you owe them money or a refund or something like that, or if you were the initial aggressor in this situation, it's important to reveal it. I won't judge you or care about it, but the solution is different from the above. Justsayin.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

As a culture we tolerate that kind of behavior and not much is done to hold those responsible or accountable in any real way, so it becomes a normal thing to do.. hence why this kind of shit is going to become more rampant as the years go by. Unless of course, by some miracle, everyone decides to do random acts of kindness or decides to just not be a dick by default.. alas, one miracle at a time.\n\nLet me know if it persists.

James dated this girl (let\u2019s call her Lissete) and it was insane and abusive from both parties . James ended up flirting\/hooking up w a lot of my girl friends. Lissete found out. Lissete has been bullying me and my friends that James hooked up w for over a year now. Either doing it off of her personal acc or making multiple accounts. She will say racist things . She has said she will key my car , and to send her \u201cpics of my bloody wrists\u201d bc it \u201cturns her on\u201d . She even sent my friend Martha a pic of her holding a knife saying \u201cy\u2019all hoes gonna die\u201d. She\u2019s insane.  What sucks is first of all I never even hooked up w James and i\u2019ve actually been in a long term relationship w his best friend so that doesn\u2019t even make sense. What also sucks is that no matter how many times u block her, she ALWAYS makes fake accounts. It is highly illegal to tell people to kill themselves or self harm. Finally , Martha\u2019s parents had enough of Lissete\u2019s harassment and have filed a police report. All like literally 25 of us submitted our evidence of her bullying and harassment.

However, uploading a video of yourself in that state where you're hysterical, crying and screaming and being physically violent isn't beneficial to you or your viewers in any way (if anything it can be detrimental, the people from the subreddit can use that as ammunition to keep doing what they're doing). Nor does it solve anything. Every point you conveyed in the video, you could've also gotten across by talking about them calmly, so in the future when this stuff happens I would recommend stepping back for a day or 2, and once you're in a good state of mind, then address your concerns in a calm and collected manner.\n \nOk so now that that's out of the way, I also would recommend trying to find a support group.

He lives across the US from me and I have not seen him in at all in that time thankfully, though occasionally he would ask me \"what would you do if I came to you and you saw me?\", though that hasn't happened for about four years now. He will use guerrillamail to send me messages, make new accounts, occasionally I get harassing messages from other accounts and I can't prove it's him but I have no doubt it is. It is off and on, not all at once. He switches between sending me messages being extremely angry and then trying to be friendly. I've also switched off being mean and being nice to him in the hopes he would stop talking to me. I know now that this wasn't smart and I shouldn't have talked to him at all or otherwise keep it EXTREMELY brief.\n\nHe sent me an email before the election telling me to be careful. He often sends me emails from guerrillamail with what would typically be friendly sentiments so he feels like he has an excuse to reach out. He also holds them over me as I didn't respond when he told me his mother was in the hospital and once I told him not to manipulate me and get professional help when he said he had slammed his head into a wall, which made him very angry. I hadn't messaged him since 2018 but this time I temporarily unblocked his email address and responded telling him to leave me alone. I then blocked guerrillamail fully and his email address.\n\nRecently he opened up an account on deviantART where he has posted two pictures of me and him from years ago, our faces are blurred out, but one is with burn marks and another is with cracks from bullets. It feels like it could be a threat. He posted a poem rant against me and a love poem about me. Recently he posted the first page of \"his autobiography\" dedicated to me where he rants very angrily, though not about me. I have reported him to the website but nothing has happened. I'm afraid of what more he will post and I feel threatened. I know he is doing it to get me to talk to him again but I don't know how far he will go.\n\nI don't know if I should take legal action. I have looked at some cyber-stalking\/cyber-bullying laws and he seems to fall into the category of a cyberbully. I'm afraid since I've spoken to him in the past and either gotten angry or pretended to be friendly that this would hurt my case.

There's a lot of explicit name calling. They keep making new accounts with different email addresses, and Instagram isn't deleting all of the accounts.

We never really think about the negative effects of social media. Adults do not see what can go around social media such\u00a0snapchat, Instagram, twitter, and Facebook. It is an exceptionally clever idea to show the parents and guardians what could be sent around that they never know of. Being bullied over the internet cause an excessive amount of emotion and could cause people to want to end their life, become extremely distant,\u00a0and even change who they are. Bullying is never a good idea, but cyberbullying is even worse cause it can be anonymous.\u00a0 \n\nCyberbullying is a big issue in the world today. This generation will go beyond to ruin someone's reputation anonymously. People make fake accounts, pretending to be someone else just to torment others. There is no conceivable way that authorities could stop this is they have no proof who is doing it. Only 1 and 10 teens tell their parents about being cyberbullied, because they do not know how to tell them without seeming dumb or that it is their fault. Our parents grew up in a whole different generation, they did not have the social media like we do today. They did not have phones that you could access anything from anywhere, they honestly do not know what is it like to live as a teenager today. Most parents think you can just delete it or ignore it but it is much harder than that. If someone genuinely wants to get underneath your skin, they will use all their power to do so.\u00a0 \n\nMore than one and three people have been cyberbullied which means it is hard to find someone who has not been threatened or made fun of over the internet. Being bullied can cause a lifetime of trust issues and become an introvert. The internet is such a wonderful place, you can talk to someone who is a million miles away from you.

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"k55r77","Title":"My story of how I was abandoned by someone I trusted on the same day when I found out that I may have been hacked by someone who has been bullying and harassing me online for YEARS!","Author":"DarknessMoonlight","Timestamp":1606899004000,"Text":"So some years ago I started hanging out in a forum where people are mostly anonymous much like how many people on Reddit are mostly anonymous too and I had fun and sometimes people were mean but nothing out of control but then I started being harassed by a dude on the forum who started becoming obsessed with me and started wanting pictures of me...\n\nOther users on the forum have also asked me for pictures but none of them crossed the line like this one did...\n\nAt first he just asked me for pictures and when I refused he would start becoming really mean and harass me acting as if he was entitled to see what I look like even though I have always made it clear for him and the other members of the forum that I was in there just to have fun and talk about stuff and maybe make some friends but not to date anyone in there...\n\nBut that was not even the worst of it... The worst part came when he started making vague references about wanting to hack me, I don't remember the exact wording but he said stuff along the lines of : \" Umm I will see if they can get it for me... \" When I told him over and over that I would not post pics on the forum or show pics to him in private as I was not interested in him...\n\nThis left me creeped out but I did not make an issue of it at the time because his statement was somewhat vague and also because I did not know him well enough at the time but it did leave me a bit scared and creeped out... This part of the harassment happened around the end of 2018 and lasted until around the first months of 2019 when he had mostly stopped coming after me...\n\nTime passed and after a while he mostly had stopped harassing me and started going after another girl on the forum which he also ended up harassing a lot and even victim blamed her for the time where she was almost raped after she shared her story with the forum looking for support to help her heal from her trauma among maaany other gross disgusting things that he said not only to her but also to other people like telling a married dude that he wanted to do stuff to the dude's wife and insulting the dude among other vulgar things... These things happened though the end of 2018 to the end of the year of 2019...\n\nBut eventually he started coming after me again... Just a few months ago around the end of July this year he started saying really creepy stuff again...\n\nHe said that he knew EXACTLY what I looked like even though I never posted pictures anywhere online...! I asked him if he was bluffing but he told me he never bluffs and then started saying more creepy stuff including making vague statements about my looks...\n\nThis made me really nervous since he had mentioned during a conversation with me earlier on this year that he had obtained a picture of another woman on that same forum without her even knowing it, which was info I didn't even ask for, it was just something that he bought up out of nowhere on a conversation that had nothing to do with her...\n\nSo I naturally got curious and asked him how he had done so and he told me that it was a \" personal secret \" of his and that he knew \" simple techniques \" which only made me even more suspicious and creeped out so I asked him what I was suspecting for a long time... Namely if he was a hacker...\n\nHe told me that he was not a hacker himself but that he was friends with hackers and that if he wanted something his hacker friends could get it for him...\n\nThat whole conversation made me really afraid of him so I tried keeping him in good terms this year until he started harassing me again for some reason after having taken a break from it for almost 1 year so when he started harassing me again July of this year I exposed him for all the harassment he did not only to me but to other people on the forum like the girl he victim blamed and the married dude that he disrespected by insulting and saying he wanted to do gross stuff to the dude's wife...\n\nEventually more and more people who were harassed by him started coming forward and said they have received some really creepy private messages from him too...\n\nSome said that he would sometimes send them private messages just to ask personal things out of nowhere to them even though they were not even friends while another person said they have received aggressive threatening private messages from him over very little... Namely being corrected on his English...\n\nOne person corrected the dude on his English and received a creepy private message from him with threatening aggressive tones like telling the person how he was not someone he would want to mess with in real life etc...\n\nThis dude that has been harassing me has anger issues in other words and it doesn't take much to set him off and make him cross the line with people...\n\nAll of this together made me really afraid of him and this whole situation made me really scared and worried that I may have been hacked and it caused me a lot of problems...\n\nI even had people who I was close to that have left and abandoned me just because I asked them for help of how to deal with this stuff...\n\nBasically I asked someone who I was close to for help in dealing with this stuff and this ended up causing an argument with us that ended up with us going our separate ways and we haven't talked for months since then...\n\nAnd this argument that broke us apart would not have happened if it wasn't for this creepy dude that may have hacked me... :(\n\nThis really broke me down I'm only starting to recover now... -\\_-\n\nFirst I found out I may have been hacked and then someone who I trusted that I was close to abandoned me on the same day due to an argument caused by me asking them for help of how to deal with this stuff... :(\n\nThere were other nasty people on that forum as well some of which I mentioned here : [https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cyberbullying\/comments\/k0j48o\/my\\_friend\\_made\\_fun\\_of\\_my\\_personal\\_life\/gdy4d9h\/?context=3](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/cyberbullying\/comments\/k0j48o\/my_friend_made_fun_of_my_personal_life\/gdy4d9h\/?context=3)\n\nBut this creepy dude caused me the most problems...\n\nIt was the combination of this creepy dude having a long history of harassing and threatening people, combined with his obsession with me, combined with him being friends with hackers, combined with his recent creepy comments saying that he knew exactly what I looked like that makes him by FAR one of the worst persons I have ever came across that harassed me online...\n\nOther folks were also bad but this creepy dude was the only one who may have committed a crime against me...\n\nThis whole incident made me start to seriously research cyber security and privacy online and try to find resources to help me...\n\nI found out some resources including these : [https:\/\/gameshotline.org\/how-it-works\/](https:\/\/gameshotline.org\/how-it-works\/) And : [https:\/\/www.cyber.gov.au\/acsc\/report\/are-you-a-victim-of-cybercrime](https:\/\/www.cyber.gov.au\/acsc\/report\/are-you-a-victim-of-cybercrime)\n\nBut these seem to be only for the USA and Australia so people from outside of there may be out of luck with these ones but the FBI may still be able to help you even if you're outside of the USA and Australia... You can report crimes to the FBI here... : [https:\/\/www.fbi.gov\/investigate\/cyber](https:\/\/www.fbi.gov\/investigate\/cyber)\n\nThe FBI explicitly mentioned that they have been dealing with cases of cyberbullying so they may help you : [https:\/\/www.fbi.gov\/audio-repository\/news-podcasts-thisweek-cyber-bullying.mp3\/view](https:\/\/www.fbi.gov\/audio-repository\/news-podcasts-thisweek-cyber-bullying.mp3\/view)\n\nDealing with cyber crimes seems to be complicated due to it often involving anonymous people who may be from very different countries with different laws and stuff but the FBI deal with international crimes and they mentioned somewhere on their site that they will investigate online crimes so long as at least one of the persons involved in the case is from the USA... Either the victim or the accused...\n\nLucky for me the dude who may have hacked me seems to be living in the USA currently as he mentioned he is in New York in some posts on the forum so the FBI may be able to help me deal with this one...\n\nThis has all been very difficult for me and even my mental health took a significant blow especially after I was abandoned... It was too much for the same day...\n\nFinding out that someone that has been harassing me for years may have hacked me and then being abandoned by someone that I trusted that I was close to due to an argument that would not have happened if it wasn't for the creepy dude that may have hacked me was just too much for me but now that it has been a few months I am better than I was before...\n\nI have calmed down and came to accept the fact that if he did indeed hack me and managed to somehow see what I look like there's nothing I can do about that now...\n\nBut I can still report him to the authorities for it as hacking people to steal stuff that they never posted online is a crime! : [https:\/\/securelist.com\/carolina-dieckmann-brazilian-cybercrime-legislation-and-la-viveza-criolla\/32842\/](https:\/\/securelist.com\/carolina-dieckmann-brazilian-cybercrime-legislation-and-la-viveza-criolla\/32842\/) :\/ : [https:\/\/www.kaspersky.com\/resource-center\/threats\/webcam-hacking](https:\/\/www.kaspersky.com\/resource-center\/threats\/webcam-hacking)\n\nAnd if he did indeed hack me he may have stolen even MORE sensitive personal stuff that he could use to dox me!\n\nI have reported the dude that may have hacked me to the moderators of the forum that I was hanging out in but nothing happened... :\/ \n\nThese moderators seem almost like they don't care... That forum's moderation is truly awful with people sometimes being banned over very little like posting a spoiler for a movie but people who have done actually horrible stuff often get away with just a slap on the waist...\n\nThere's some SERIOUS lack of resources and support for people who are being bullied and harassed online even when actual crimes like hacking and doxxing may be involved! :(\n\nFor now I'm focusing on what I can actually do to help myself and other people who have been bullied and harassed online so if anyone knows any resources or something that can help me and other people please do share! It would be much appreciated! :)\n\nRight now I'm focusing on gathering as much personal info about the dude who may have hacked me as I can find... He posted a lot on the forum I was hanging out...\n\nSo far I managed to find his first name, age, year of birth, height, location and career among a few other things that he himself posted on the forum...\n\nAll of which I will give to the FBI to help them track him down and deal with him as he should really not be doing this!\n\nRegardless of whenever he really hacked me or not he should really not be bullying and harassing people online like this! :(\n\nThis dude said he works in law enforcement! A person in law enforcement shouldn't be bullying, harassing and possibly hacking people like this! That's public corruption which is another thing the FBI investigates and is the thing they give priority to apparently so I'm definitely reporting this dude! : [https:\/\/www.fbi.gov\/investigate\/public-corruption](https:\/\/www.fbi.gov\/investigate\/public-corruption)","Score":6,"Total_comments":5}

HMM? what? you didn't? wow! then why did i mention that in my blog, hmm? even so, i am allowed to vent. i don't mention names because some of my \"fans\" are young and crazy, which i don't like, and they go after people without my consent. so sorry that YOU wanted to be bullied for something SOMEONE ELSE did.\n\ni don't expect you to apologize because it's clear you're not that kind of person. i am used to being bullied. in 2020 alone, i was violently bullied, stalked, accused of crimes i'd never commit, an army was built against me just because of a couple of stans were upset i wasn't the GOD they thought i was, i was fucking DOXXED, and my shit life went so much deeper into shit, I DON'T WANT TO BE ALIVE.\n\nbut i'm sorry. i'm so sorry that i didn't treat you like you were dumb. i'm sorry i didn't give you attention by lying about you and causing people to bully you. i'm sorry for calmly explaining the difference between excuses and explanations. i'm sorry for not being a bitch to you. and most of all, i'm sorry for fucking existing. i hope, for the sake of others, you learn not to jump down people's throats for YOUR mistakes.\n\nand if you're curious, the blog vent was triggered by KarimaQueen, and the reason why it triggered me is because SO MANY PEOPLE have said the exact same things. i didn't want to fucking cry today. now my cat is meowing at me because she knows i'm upset. i want you to apologize, so if you're not the asshole you presented yourself to be, then apologize and make it right. otherwise, don't respond to me. i'm so sick and tired of being attacked like this.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

One kid I'm working with right now has run into a lot of problems with cyberbullying. As I'm sure a lot of other people are experiencing, online communications are really central right now, and being a virtual middle schooler is no easier. \n\nI was wondering if anybody knows of any online support groups or something comparable that I can recommend to this family. I've found lots of websites with crisis hotlines and the like which are great things to have, but as this kid will also have an individual therapist and access to a crisis team should one arise, I would really love to find an avenue for this child to be able to talk with others who have dealt with something similar, either on a regular basis or not. This sub is about the closest and best thing I've found so far, but I don't think I can, in good conscience, professionally recommend a subreddit to the family. \n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read, and good luck and love to everybody struggling with virtual life.

He has some language comprehension and processing delays along with severe ADD, and as a consequence, he has had a tough time understanding the world around him. Movies, TV, and books are mostly incomprehensible to him because he cannot focus or process the narrative or plot. Even conversation is difficult when you only hear 1 out of every 3 or 4 words and can't process the ones you do hear normally. He's often depressed, angry, and frustrated, and lacks confidence in himself, constantly saying \"There's so many things wrong with my brain.\" You can imagine how that feels to a parent.\n\nAmong Us seemed like a good game for him because it seems straightforward with simple tasks, and the games are fairly fast. He took an immediate interest and we usually have to tear it out of his hands. What we didn't account for was the chat feature, as we thought it was a quick opportunity to say who you thought the imposter was, and not much time or opportunity to discuss more. We found out today that that was not the case. Apparently he voted for someone as the imposter, and this person asked him how old he was. After he responded 9, the person cussed at him, called him names, told everyone to \"ban\" him (I dont even know if this is really a thing in the game), and somehow kicked him out of the game. He's been crying ever since, has not been able to sleep, and most of all keeps asking us why someone would do that to someone they didnt know who didn't do anything to them. I should mention that even though he's 9, his maturity level is closer to that of a 7 year old, and super sensitive. We've deleted the game and will maybe play it again someday but only as a family.\n\nI came here not to ask you how to find the perpetrator or anything; I'm well aware there's no way to track people in a game with no user accounts, and besides the culprit is probably a kid as young if not younger than him, and the things he said could very well have been a lot worse. But I know many people here may have had similar experiences playing this game, or other games, at such a young age, and may be able to relate to his experience. I wanted to ask if you wouldn't mind sharing some of them in a way that a 9 year old could understand, and most importantly, share tips on how you've hopefully been able to shake that kind of behavior off. It's important I think that he understand that he is not alone, and that this is not something he should let affect him so deeply. If you are willing to share by replying to this post, I will share the answers with him and also my appreciation and gratitude with you.","Score":3,"Total_comments":8}

You never know who will contact him. Even someone your age could contact your son and try to become his \"secret friend\" that you won't know about. I hope I don't have to tell you about things that could happen in that situation.\n\n> Movies, TV, and books are mostly incomprehensible to him because he cannot focus or process the narrative or plot.\n\nSo you should help him instead of using simple yet dangerous solution which are online games.\n\n> Even conversation is difficult when you only hear 1 out of every 3 or 4 words and can't process the ones you do hear normally.\n\nAgain, if there are difficulties with conversation you should be the person that is talking to him, teaching him how to talk and what he can or can't say.\n\n> He's often depressed, angry, and frustrated, and lacks confidence in himself, constantly saying \"There's so many things wrong with my brain.\" You can imagine how that feels to a parent.\n\nI can imagine how it feels to a parent but imagine how it feels to him. If your kid is depressed you should spend more time with him. He needs you, not random people from the internet.\n\n> Among Us seemed like a good game for him because it seems straightforward with simple tasks, and the games are fairly fast.\n\nI guess there are many other, more importantly singleplayer, games that would be easy for him.\n\n> He took an immediate interest and we usually have to tear it out of his hands.\n\nI don't think it's good sign. Maybe your kid is happy for that while but at what cost?\n\n> What we didn't account for was the chat feature, as we thought it was a quick opportunity to say who you thought the imposter was, and not much time or opportunity to discuss more.\n\nI'm not sure because I don't play this game myself but I don't think there is any time limit and everything depends on when people will vote.\n\n> We found out today that that was not the case. Apparently he voted for someone as the imposter, and this person asked him how old he was. After he responded 9, the person cussed at him, called him names, told everyone to \"ban\" him (I dont even know if this is really a thing in the game), and somehow kicked him out of the game.\n\nHe shouldn't tell anybody about his age or anything personal. You never know who plays game with your kid and there may be even some old guy sitting on the other side, reading the chat and just waiting for some kid that will disclose his age. That's how pedophiles are hunting for kids online, they don't ask every person for age, they wait until someone will tell them or write in the chat.\n\nIn relation to the ban I'm not sure. The game was rated as PEGI 16 at the start and then reclassified as PEGI 7 which means that technically your son can play this game but I still don't think it's good choice anyway.\n\nIn relation to kicking him from the game, probably this person was hosting the game so he could kick everybody from the same room.\n\n> He's been crying ever since, has not been able to sleep, and most of all keeps asking us why someone would do that to someone they didnt know who didn't do anything to them. I should mention that even though he's 9, his maturity level is closer to that of a 7 year old, and super sensitive.\n\nIf you know that your son is super sensitive and at the same time you know how bad people can be on the internet, why would you even just let him to whatever he wants there. You should control it somehow.\n\nYou should explain to your son that he did nothing wrong it was somebody's decision to kick him from the game. He can't make everybody like him, there will be people who will like playing the game with him and there will be some who won't, and there is nothing you can do about it.\n\n> We've deleted the game and will maybe play it again someday but only as a family.\n\nThat's best option IMO. He will be happy because he will be playing this game and you will be spending time with him so I see only positive things here.\n\n> I came here not to ask you how to find the perpetrator or anything; I'm well aware there's no way to track people in a game with no user accounts, and besides the culprit is probably a kid as young if not younger than him, and the things he said could very well have been a lot worse.\n\nTechnically there is but I can't imagine FBI or NSA sending a warrant to whoever owns the game servers, getting IP address of whoever was in the game at this time, then tracking down this person by sending another warrant to his ISP, finally going to his house and proving somehow that it was his nickname and device.\n\n> But I know many people here may have had similar experiences playing this game, or other games, at such a young age, and may be able to relate to his experience. I wanted to ask if you wouldn't mind sharing some of them in a way that a 9 year old could understand, and most importantly, share tips on how you've hopefully been able to shake that kind of behavior off. It's important I think that he understand that he is not alone, and that this is not something he should let affect him so deeply. If you are willing to share by replying to this post, I will share the answers with him and also my appreciation and gratitude with you.\n\nIMO you should spend more time with your son, explain to him that nobody is perfect and there will be people who will like him and people who won't like him no matter what he would do. Now he needs conversation with you and he needs to spend good time with family to forget about what happened in the game. I'm not psychologist but I in most cases good memories will replace those bad ones so you should try that.\n\nIn relation to tips I can only tell you that you should think more about what can happen if e.g. you give internet access to your kid. Think about those good things e.g. he can meet some nice people, have a good time, find some new friends etc. but you have to think about those bad things too and prevent them from happening e.g. people who will feel satisfaction only because they are harassing somebody, basically everyone who can make your kid feel bad for some reason.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"juw4yg","Title":"Happy Trans Awareness Week! Here's a life update with some celebrations, concerns & questions! Cyber-bullying is absolutely one of the concerns\/questions and you'll see it begin to be described about halfway through. I feel the whole story is important for context and even better feedback! Thanks!!","Author":"TaylorLakhryst","Timestamp":1605483561000,"Text":"Hi everyone! With it being Trans Awareness Week I feel it's a great time to share a life update with the internet! I came out pretty abruptly this summer and things got exceptionally cranked up in August when my parents reacted exactly as I expected. It really lit a fire under me. I couldn't file for a legal name change fast enough and I feel I have absolutely stripped off the shackles that kept me as a fraction of myself for my entire life. I have since been working incredibly hard at advocating for trans rights in quite a few situations and so far I am pretty proud about myself. I've found most of my time over the past few months on r\/Twitter. I don't have r\/Facebook or r\/Instagramaccounts for example and I ended up in the middle of a ... [rather serious project](https:\/\/twitter.com\/energy106fm\/status\/1299527429485203456).\n\nUltimately, I've got three goals I'd like to accomplish as part of my journey. My first goal is based on my belief that we are long overdue for visible r\/trans inclusivity in r\/sports, and by that I mean have dialogue present regarding rules, policies, divisions, insurance and so on explaining that divisions are based on r\/gender identity & expression, not biological sex. That said, I am aware of the fluidity of that statement and understand there are times where in the interest of competitiveness or player safety physiological factors need to be considered, especially at elite-level play or in sports where weight classes matter. Overall though, there is no reason otherwise why trans r\/athletes should be prevented from or discriminated against competing in a division that is in line with their preferred gender identity and\/or expression.\n\n[I've got a thread that I'm using](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1317475890691928065) to keep some awareness up particularly relating to Sport Manitoba (while it also was [a retweet throwing a bit of shade](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1298790120447852545) to a local radio station hiring [a known transphobic radio host](https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/manitoba\/winnipeg-wheeler-trans-comments-1.4749616) who [has been endorsed by a member of our queer community](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ctvwinnipeg\/status\/1298775987761553413) and insists they will continue to be [one of the strongest media allies to the LGBTQ community in Winnipeg](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/3mRIcuj.jpg). \\*sorrywhat.gif\\*\n\nI'll get back to the radio station in a bit. That thread also dropped [a note to Slo-Pitch National regarding their rules](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1316459613038886912) and of where trans athletes are to fall in with their verbiage. I'm happy to report that unlike the [bureaucratic approach I feel I received from Sport Manitoba](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/SuNDvfq.jpg), Slo-Pitch National was almost [immediately engaged after a few tweet attempts went their way](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1319835275351085056). I had an absolutely wonderful conversation with Trish and I strongly believe we will be having more follow-up conversations about how to implement things effectively, assertively, competitively and in a way that prevents abuse.\n\nIf I can help encourage programs to start having more visible acknowledgement of trans athletes and having inclusive dialogue and programming in their systems, that will do nothing but benefit one of the core obstacles about trans people in general: awareness. That verbiage can introduce conversations earlier, end controversies sooner, offer courage and support to trans people from children to adults that they have a welcoming place to belong, provide an improved fundamental understanding that people are different and to open minds and hearts about it, and even to improve demographics so that better social, medical, educational, and r\/mentalhealth services can become available.\n\nMy second goal, as a matter of fact, is to at least be put in consideration for the [Order of Manitoba](https:\/\/www.manitobalg.ca\/awards\/order-of-manitoba\/). I never thought about it before but I remember coming across it at some point and thought, \"Screw this. I'm earning it.\" The Order of Manitoba was established to recognize individuals who have demonstrated excellence and achievement in any field of endeavour benefiting in an outstanding manner the social, cultural or economic well-being of r\/Manitoba and its residents. I feel that if I continue to work as hard as I can to break barriers, raise awareness and continue to denounce injustice against not only r\/transgender Manitobans but transgender people as a whole, the least I could hope for is to be thought of when it's time to think of who helps make Manitoba be a better place. Personally, I've suffered a walled-up life for pretty much 39 years and if I can do my part to ensure that no person has to feel like they need to be anyone but their authentic and best selves, I will pull out every stop that I am able to because unless you're trans, you simply don't get what it's like.\n\nA rather surreal experience that reminded me that I'm on course to my goal lately was having conversation with the national director of the Run for Women! It started after I pinned [a note](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/cJEisYc.jpg) on my Twitter profile which eventually led to an amazing response and a subsequent Zoom session with Ted and Stephanie. Hearing the interest, recognition, and commitment to make the Run for Women a more welcoming and inclusive event for all r\/women was exciting, and being asked to be kept in touch with during the progress has felt immensely meaningful.\n\nI feel I have really taken advocacy for trans rights seriously ever since I came out and that leads to my third goal that I currently have. I feel I am on a path of creating a legacy and I can only hope that one day people will hear my name and immediately recognize my effort to raise awareness and help normalize the belonging of trans people in a predominantly cisnormative world. Sometimes it feels petty but I would absolutely love to get verified by Twitter at some point because of that. As much as blue isn't my favourite colour, I feel it would look great beside [my name](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst). I feel it's a great way to suggest that I know what I'm doing and I'm not taking any of this lightly at all.\n\nWhen I came out as abruptly as I did, it was with the full intention to raise awareness and educate, especially using the element of shock to prompt reflections into the minds of others. I came out right after George Floyd was murdered because our planet was reeling on yet another example that if you're not White and Right, you're fighting for a place to coexist. Minority groups all over the planet, and obviously the Black community at large, were screaming for reforms to improve diversity, r\/Equity and r\/Inclusion. To eliminate r\/racism. To eliminate discrimination. I felt there was no better time to capture that momentum. After I came out, I lost track of the amount of times someone would say that they had no idea, and rightfully so. I began to come out socially on my 39th birthday so for all intents and purposes the only person most people ever knew or recognized was a white, athletic, 39-year-old r\/Canadian male. I was as close to the top of the food chain that someone could really get. I bled privilege that I didn't even want because it was nothing but imbued irony because it would almost all be erased if I allowed myself to be vulnerable and authentic.\n\nBecoming vulnerable and authentic is exactly what I chose to do. I didn't do that necessarily because I wanted to, and it certainly wasn't because I was ready to, but I had no choice except that I HAD to. As a person, I am far too strong, far too vocal, far too educated and far too articulated to stay quiet any longer. I know I've got the skillset and r\/resilience to help make the world a better place and if anything I feel guilty for not allowing myself to start working on it years earlier. Even as I write about this life update, I think about [a blog post that was written about me](https:\/\/spitfiretakesontheworld.blogspot.com\/2020\/10\/what-taylor-should-say-to-energy-106.html?spref=tw) and to this day am so humbled about it. More than ever have I felt like I'm making a difference instead of being a burden and it inspires me to keep pushing forward.\n\nI've alluded to it a couple times already and one of the biggest missions I have been on lately is advocating on the absolute faux pas of a local radio station hiring someone who has [said dehumanizing things about transgender people](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/fTBn0CX), [has not shown public atonement for it](https:\/\/www.winnipegfreepress.com\/local\/winnipegs-radio-radical-is-ready-to-wrangle-572233362.html), and then being protected by the radio station while they affirm to be r\/LGBTQ\\+ allies. One of the biggest reasons I am invested in this is because of the message that is being sent to minority communities across the board: If you are privileged, you are protected. The message that forgiveness is to be expected of the victims instead of earned by the offenders really sums up segregation, discrimination and overall mental unwellness in a nutshell.\n\nPersonally, I felt my drive for this situation to really light up after Energy 106 FM posted their \"Official Statement,\" which for the record was Friday, August 28, at 9:00 PM. Only until recently in a meeting I had with [Adam West, their Program Director](https:\/\/www.energy106.ca\/adam-west\/), that they had intention of posting that late largely due to Facebook algorithms. All I really had to reply on that was considering the amount of controversy regarding the release of the message, they could have at least addressed the concern with an explanation instead of perpetually ignoring the call-outs. Another interesting take in that same meeting was that they were waiting for that memo to be vetted by one transgender person, which I learned after asking who the \"numerous meaningful and significant conversations\" involved because I can't imagine a single resource centre in r\/Winnipeg that would have given this hire a green light. Regardless, I had no problem [expressing my thoughts about the situation](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1299539266561744897) and since made a decision to keep my eye on it.\n\nOne of the reasons why I struggled to feel comfortable coming out was because I wasn't ready to be as loud as I knew I was capable of being. For at least half my life I've felt that people like me needed a warrior to be there for them. I wanted to be that warrior but I simply did not feel like I was capable of the fight. As much as I knew I already was being suffocated, I needed to know I could be there for others. It took me a long time but when I finally found it in me [I have never been more proud to be myself](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1321581036304621568) and to fight for my community. r\/Allyship isn't a part-time job. It is like being that warrior I mentioned. It doesn't necessarily mean you're looking for a fight, but you must be ready to go to battle when the time comes. I wasn't ready to fight for myself before. Today, I fight for change.\n\nTwitter certainly was a hotbed after Energy decided to release their \"Official Statement\" affirming their belief that [their hire was the right decision](https:\/\/www.winnipegfreepress.com\/local\/provocative-dj-dave-wheeler-gets-a-new-mic-572220242.html). There were links and stories and updates and advocates and affirmations from all angles, [even on the other side of the ocean](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Energy106\/status\/1298689207955869697). After realizing how many stories and concerns there were, I decided to make my path of advocacy easier to follow, literally, and I did that by [creating a thread on Twitter](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1305894111925288961) that sourced everything to follow in one place.\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles with advocacy is it often means you're fighting from a weaker position, as in, it's not uncommon for change to be made because of necessity instead of r\/morality. When it comes to advocating against corporate boondoggling often change would only ultimately be recognized after corporate partners disagree with the decision and decide to withdraw, and [that's where the adventure really began](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1305900918735425536).\n\nIt was fantastic and encouraging to see many corporate allies of the LGBTQ+ community to stand in r\/Solidarity with us and denounce the decision made by Energy 106 FM, or more specifically, the Evanov Radio Group. During the unrest it was uncovered that Dave Wheeler was [hired with approval of Paul Evanov](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/YascAtG.mp4) himself, which he shared during one of his podcast episodes of Wheeler After Dark.\n\nI still have conflicted feelings about that. How does Paul Evanov, who's father Bill developed the [world's first 100% LGBT front-to-back radio station](https:\/\/www.broadcasting-history.ca\/listing_and_histories\/radio\/cirr-fm), [who passed away on February 28, 2020](http:\/\/evanovradio.com\/vasil-william-evanov\/), personally approve this hire, affirm support by a PR firm (of which I have solid hunches about but am still piecing it together), and be OK with this? Why does Wheeler say in that soundbite that \"they're ready\" now? I can't imagine what the delay would have been, unless we think of crazy supervillain vibes where Paul was waiting for all the legal stuff about Bill to be finished. Dave was unemployed for two years. Was Adam asking Paul to ask Bill to give Dave a job for two years, and now that Daddy's out of the picture Paul can finally be the one to say yes? How does any leadership in an organization that has a globally-accessible r\/LGBT-focused radio station that is one of their jewels completely overlook the responsibility of public atonement at a value greater than public shaming, or more accurately disregard its importance? It's completely baffling but truly represents again what life is like with privilege.\n\nI completely understand that Wheeler's termination from his last station [wasn't without controversy](https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/manitoba\/dave-wheeler-sues-rogers-92-citi-fm-winnipeg-1.4831614), but what feels like something completely overlooked is that his language was spoken with fluidity. He utilized an opportunity to share unfiltered thoughts AND get paid for it. That's privilege. The idea of being able to speak your beliefs for personal gain with no disregard for hurt or harm: that's privilege.\n\nTo get the opportunity to have a public voice again, especially now targeted TOWARDS the demographic who have been harmed by the hateful and dehumanizing speech without any sign of public grief or atonement: that's privilege. To expect forgiveness and acceptance instead of earning forgiveness and trust: that's privilege.\n\nThat's why I advocate. The message that your privilege will protect you and anyone lesser has to fight for r\/equality continues to be too strong, too frequent, and [too deadly](https:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/canada\/manitoba\/dave-wheeler-fired-trans-comments-1.4751460).\n\nWhat had me so confused, if not frustrated at the situation, was how the hire didn't raise concerns of transphobia but other forms of discrimination such as racism and sexism as well. One of the most ... eye opening ... experiences was Adam's response to me in one of our meetings where he didn't believe \"[Black Olives Matter](https:\/\/www.podchaser.com\/podcasts\/wheeler-after-dark-with-dave-c-707535\/episodes\/196-days-72288477)\" (Starting at \\~16:44) was racism. Adam's argument to me was that Dave is a comedian and as such this should be considered a parody. I am not a person of colour by any stretch to know what racism feels like directly, but for him to flatly reject the message that has been spoken LOUDLY by our BIPOC community showed, again, privilege and another reason why I have to keep fighting. What's baffling is that podcast episode with the \"parody\" was uploaded on August 14, 2020 ... only TWO WEEKS prior to Energy's release of their \"Official Statement\" defending their hire. Further examples of racism were brought up by other members of our community, such as [a podcast episode validating Blackface](https:\/\/www.buzzsprout.com\/194867\/3930497-blackface-part-iv?play=true) (starting at \\~35:20, released on May 27, 2020, two days after George Floyd was murdered, and with no hesitation to shame the \"woke\" generation), an [anti-Indigenous parody of the Wet'suwet'en protests](https:\/\/streamable.com\/f3g1xo) on February 21, 2020 (plus referencing to the protest as [looking like an anus](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/UB24QlA.jpg)), and [validating police brutality](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/TdAbZtK.mp4) to the death of Eishia Hudson (the 16-year-old Indigenous teen who was shot dead on April 16, 2020). He's stated and has been defended that he \"[has done a lot of work](https:\/\/www.chrisd.ca\/2020\/08\/24\/dave-wheeler-morning-show-energy-106\/)\" since getting fired, but I'm struggling to see where it has even started. I am at an absolute loss when it comes to seeing how this history is even close to being welcome at a self-professed LGBTQ+-friendly station, especially considering they fired a woman who was an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community to make space for him and another woman. His personal Wheeler After Dark! podcast explicitly describes the episodes as \"[not intended for those that are easily offended by adult themes, spicy language, satire, dark humour, etc, etc, etc... If you're a kid... You likely shouldn't be listening to this, but you should tell your parents to, they'd find it hilarious!](https:\/\/www.iheart.com\/podcast\/256-wheeler-in-the-morning-wit-43049197\/)\"\n\nBeing an ally doesn't have on-and-off \"modes.\" You can't be a representative of allyship when you're under someone else's watch and especially while under someone else's salary. Allyship is an authentic effort from the heart. It isn't always flawless and it isn't always life-possessing but the motivation has to come from within yourself and it absolutely must represent your honest values. It absolutely stuns me about how Energy 106 FM, and more specifically the Evanov Radio Group, is completely dense to the insensitivity caused by their hire and exceptionally so by standing behind it. [The responsibility of being an ally is not to be taken lightly](https:\/\/guidetoallyship.com\/), otherwise the actions will be exposed and shown to be [performative activism for personal gain](https:\/\/medium.com\/illumination\/the-difference-between-performative-activism-and-genuine-allyship-c1071133d0e0). As such, I continued (and continue) to advocate. Our minority communities have been run over far too frequently to stand aside to reckless privilege.\n\nA few weeks after it was clear that Energy was firm in their decision, I decided it was time to [get even more involved](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1306628473390166016). I was right on the cusp of socially-transitioning to full-time and used that moment as a chapter in my life to [show I'm taking advocating for what's right seriously](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1309278746491273217) and have been on it since. One of my most important processes was identifying business affiliates with the radio group. While it started with raising awareness to direct advertisers and implore them to assess their values, see if they are in line with the decisions at Energy, and withdraw their advertising if they don't support it. Many advertisers pulled which was wonderful to see as support, but I personally had a fire ignited after [I came across a video from Wheeler in the Morning parodying transgender people](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1306996490833854464).\n\nThe video has since been set to private and in [a meeting I had with Tyler](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/OtfZz1S.png) he explained the video was set to private after I called it out because of the aforementioned legal dispute. Regardless, I advised that setting it to private doesn't address the video existing. The message of setting it to private is \"Oh, this is worth keeping, you're not supposed to see it though.\" I advised him to have someone on Energy's Twitter account acknowledge my post with that exact remark about legal, to do something that represents anything close to allyship instead of continuing to be deflective and secretive.\n\nRegardless, when I saw that video for the first time, the comments had a description that lit me up more than ever. \"Superheroes... Every last one of 'em.\"\n\n[A superhero possesses abilities beyond those of ordinary people, who typically uses their powers to help the world become a better place, or is dedicated to protecting the public, and stopping evil.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1306997230771920904)\n\n[I'm transgender & I am god damned proud of it. I did NOT abruptly become socially & publicly visible to my workplace, sports leagues & peers immediately after the Floyd murder to have Energy's clown car run over MY goal of raising awareness about diversity, inclusion and equality.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1306997691264557056)\n\nBetween my parents responding exactly as I expected (who I still have not heard from them to this day, and we're going on about 3m1w at the time of this post), plus Energy and Evanov clearly embracing their decision, my fire has been lit more than ever. This world has never seen as strong as a version of me, and I have barely even teased my potential. I decided that Energy is not enough. If Paul Evanov decided to sign off on it, [Tyler picks up an additional role in the Evanov Radio Group with a segment on the aforementioned radio station PROUD FM](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1306621705146646528), and zero suggestion they are reconsidering their decisions, I decided the right way to gain awareness was to expand deeper into the radio group. I decided that it was time to [address not only advertisers but any visible business associate](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1307355411972980737) with Energy 106 FM, [Hot 100.5 FM](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1307354292639076353), [CKJS 810 AM](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1307354599058145280), and PROUD FM.\n\nEver since I started to advocate on this project, I was close to certain that Energy 106 muted me. If they blocked me I would have seen it, but if they muted me I would have had no idea. However, I realized eventually that Energy [did in fact have the ability to see my mentions and replies the whole time](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1307051046372548612). I blocked out what Matt mentioned as sensitivity to his message but it seems he chose to engage it further. He chose to react on a post on Energy's account regarding a pizza promotion, and a picture he used on the post was one of him and his child. [It was Energy's account and I had a question to their promotion sponsor](https:\/\/twitter.com\/svnflowers_k\/status\/1307072376081985541), but what ultimately transpired was Matt's wife deciding to ... well, [here](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1307043843477471233).\n\nThat's not to say that Energy or any accomplices hasn't been aware of my advocacy otherwise. From Day 1 (or as close to it that I can imagine), AJ blocked me for whatever reason but had no problem following a [conversation I had involving a business partner to PROUD FM](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1310786943177744384) and [throwing likes to the counterpoints of mine](https:\/\/twitter.com\/svnflowers_k\/status\/1310932294425890818). Of course, sometimes the [main account will make accidents too](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9C808yQ.png) but I had no problem capturing it. Why would they continue to be silent when they insist to be \"allies?\"\n\n[I am DONE with this world running on hate & dollars instead of heartbeats & common sense. I did NOT abruptly put MY health, MY safety & MY neck on the line inspire change to have Paul Evanov, the Evanov Radio Group, Adam West and Energy 106 FM suggest that being queer isn't profitable enough & try to prove it during a GLOBAL SOCIAL CRISIS.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1307413726358724610)\n\nI feel I have shown with more than enough character and conviction that I know what I'm doing, I know what I'm talking about, and I'm fighting so that we don't need to keep fighting in the future. I advocate strongly for mental health awareness and do my best to engage as much as possible with patience and objective reasoning. I have had people ask if it's OK to come out to me in private messages because they felt there was a safe space. I have had businesses reach out to me about various topics up to and including what could be an appropriate course of action with some of their decisions so that they continue to represent themselves as strong corporate r\/allies. I have lost track of the amount of praise, r\/gratitude and r\/encouragement from so many people in our community. I have had mindful conversations with people immensely frustrated with racism and white supremacy. I have had compassionate conversations with people who want to be allies and are unsure what to do. I have had educational conversations with people about what a trans experience may be like, and I have had many wonderful conversations with trans people of a variety of backgrounds and experiences and shared stories about our journeys. I have had conversations with people who have felt inspired from me, I have had conversations with people who were feeling unwell, and I have had conversations to the point of committing time and awareness with people who were feeling suicidal so that we could get through the moment and work on recovery strategies.\n\nThat's not to say that it hasn't been without it's challenges, but has led to some awareness as well! After about a month of constant backlash since sticking to their hire, [Energy posted a podcast episode Tyler did with a local podcast group, Winnipeg's Finest](https:\/\/www.energy106.ca\/2020\/09\/30\/tyler-carr-has-an-honest-talk-about-energy-106\/), which would to me suggest that Energy shares the perspective and sentiments he shared. I felt it was a good opportunity to express frustration about [not being given the opportunity to discuss these changes after being force-told to forgive a transphobic, sexist, racist bigot](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1311281926892695552). The podcast inspired me to respond with a video of my own, as a matter of fact. After [listening to the podcast](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1311367467986378752) a couple of times I decided to [record a YouTube video of my own](https:\/\/youtu.be\/lZYJyhmwSzQ), completely unfiltered and unedited, pausing at every talking point that contradicted an experience, questioning bias, and so on. The video took me hours! 5 hours, actually! It was my very first time on r\/YouTube too! I felt I had no time to waste and took a huge gamble on how it came out but I feel really proud of myself for what I did! I made sure to include [chapter markers of every talking point](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/dKMFH7R) as well and ... gosh, there are lots.\n\nLike I said, it hasn't been without its challenges, that's for sure. [Cranking up the advocacy](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1307420054280003585) absolutely raised the eyebrows of many for both [good](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Hoodedarche0\/status\/1307529836605452289) and, let's call it \"[uneducated](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TheLadySmoke\/status\/1307068286421606402)\", reasons. I'm very grateful to be part of a community who helps support each other especially when there is a serious social concern in the works. I feel especially grateful to be a recognizable and trusted person during this entire adventure and I truly would never wish to have taken a different path. Even though I believe that Adam and Tyler only agreed to speak with me out of obligation to a CBSC \"[Complaint re ENERGY 106 CHWE-FM Broadcast](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/7NT7eLj)\" (even though it was never addressed as a reason but the timing to start talking and the dis-interest of engaging in r\/Zoom conversations when r\/COVID19 restrictions ramped up feel incredibly coincidental), I did do my best to be a helpful liaison between the radio station and our LGBTQ+ community. I continued to be engaged and [offered awareness, consultation, advice and concerns via email](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/oL0ZEjN). I started and maintained [a thread about what allyship looks like to people and what it would take for them to see Energy 106 FM as an ally](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1313236963995000832) again. For that project alone, I went as far back into relevant time as I could and tried to connect with nearly every user I could find that reacted to Energy 106 FM hiring Dave Wheeler. Loose math from my notes suggests I have tried to connect with about 1600 people. I have personally DM'd about 750 people and every last piece of feedback has been included in the thread. In my [last meeting that I had at Energy](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1318972358711939074), Megan told me that she has been following the entire thread so I at least had an affirmation that the effort has been acknowledged.\n\nUnfortunately, that's also about where it ended. While the start of my emails and correspondence was pleasant and positive communication, it didn't take too long to redirect the focus to some rather important pieces of discussion. It's very clear that since hiring Dave and promoting Wheeler In The Morning as their new morning show, they have enabled a safe space for an extremely far-right culture including [white supremacy, transphobia, racism, and a general disrespect for human decency. There has been stalking, doxxing, libel, cyberbullying](https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/y6G5WEM) and an absolute maelstrom of right-wing chaos and panic.\n\nWhat has been incredibly baffling is how Adam and Energy were literally [offered an example of a script to use to stay engaged, not overpromise their direction while denouncing all the values that authentic allies fight against](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1318526814986268679), they decided to ignore all that and ask for everyone to \"[be kind](https:\/\/twitter.com\/energy106fm\/status\/1318276615705690114).\" If that doesn't have \"stand back and standby\" written all over it, I don't know what does.\n\nSo, this is the part where I ask for r\/feedback! I have a few considerations in my mind so far but am curious about where the next part of my journey should go. I know I'm going to continue to raise awareness of the situation to any visible business affiliates, and likely I will up the ante now to all Evanov Radio Group stations from coast to coast. As a matter of fact, I will be including affiliates to the Winnipeg Goldeyes as well because [they censored me when I asked them about their values compared to their affiliation with Energy 106 FM](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1320019452772012033). As a trans r\/athlete, the simple concept of our local r\/AAbaseballteam promoting Diversity Day in the past but censoring me about their values towards diversity, inclusion and equity disgusted me and prompted me to [immediately throw my jersey in the garbage](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1320437091910627328). I will never wear a Goldeyes jersey again, especially so long as they don't respond to my questions.\n\nSee, I know what I'm doing is powerful, successful and fearful. Why else would the Wheeler-in-the-Morning-fanclub cry to Twitter to [suspend my account](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/CrPLgHp.jpg)? That is arguably one of the most flattering things to come my way, to know that I am the haunting reason for people who are so insecure with themselves they have become possessed and obsessed with my existence, and know they are utterly desperate to silence me during my advocacy about trans rights and fundamentally basic r\/humanrights means WHAT I AM DOING IS WORKING AND I WILL NOT QUIT. I must express reservations about Twitter's judgement, however. Oh well. I will earn the blue star, I will be verified, and I WILL bring our trans community to a safer, healthier place.\n\nThis cycles back to seeing what feedback is available. I firmly believe these accounts are affiliated to Energy 106 FM or the Evanov Radio Group as a whole. The biggest reason why it comes to mind are based on three things: 1) One of the main antagonists has an account that opened in September 2020, shortly after Dave Wheeler deleted his own account, and [targeted a tweet I commented on](https:\/\/twitter.com\/TaylorLakhryst\/status\/1309486497591042050). 2) After my last meeting at Energy, Adam affirmed to me that \"he'll take care of them\" when I told him that the little band waving Energy's flag is doing nothing but making his brand look worse, because they are absolutely not doing anything to me. I noticed a near-immediate decline in activity from the fun-club for a small period of time and struggle to believe that wasn't as per Adam's memo. Add the fact that Tyler affirmed to me that he would publicly denounce their behaviour and that has not happened either. So, Energy, Adam, and Tyler have all the means to blatantly denounce white supremacy, harassment, racism, transphobia, r\/doxxing, r\/stalking, libel, defamation, and so on ... yet completely refuse to. What other option can it be? 3) [This is a little too coincidental](https:\/\/twitter.com\/svnflowers_k\/status\/1322208994333741056), and if it was done \"in satire because Dave is a comedian\" (as per Adam) then it shows they are aware of the situation and continue to refuse to address it.\n\nI find it interesting that these accounts have a massive obsession about broadcasting far-right political beliefs and stalking me. Feel free to see for yourself about the obsession since the end of September for all these folks:\n\n[BigFonker21](https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=(from%3Afonker21)%20(to%3ATaylorLakhryst)%20since%3A2020-09-25&src=typed_query&f=live), [Brittany Anne](https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=(from%3ABrittan60572844)%20(to%3ATaylorLakhryst)%20since%3A2020-09-25&src=typed_query&f=live), [Nicholas1226](https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=(from%3ANicholas12261)%20(to%3ATaylorLakhryst)%20since%3A2020-09-25&src=typed_query&f=live), [a](https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=(from%3Apom569)%20(to%3ATaylorLakhryst)%20since%3A2020-09-25&src=typed_query&f=live), [Hanz Rules!](https:\/\/twitter.com\/search?q=(from%3AHanz_Ledbetter)%20(to%3ATaylorLakhryst)%20since%3A2020-09-25&src=typed_query&f=live) and an obsessive amount of boosting from [Boo](https:\/\/twitter.com\/Boo15733919). I'm sure there are more but if I really wanted to look for Cancer I'd rather go r\/stargazing. And frankly, these are simply about things I see directly. I have been told my more than enough peers that this crowd stalks them as well, but peculiarly block those peers if this fun-club doesn't get the reaction they want.\n\nWhat's especially curious about the situation is that while these users are beyond obsessed with me an have lept over so many lines, I still have no reason to believe that it's not within the Evanov Radio Group and of all things they even have my home address which I needed to include when I wrote my concern to CBSC, so at what point am I to not feel as if Adam or Dave would not use it out of vengeance against me by the time I am done advocating against Evanov Radio Group and their perpetual injustices? People may ask why I shared my address, and the answer is to continue to be open, transparent, and show validity that Energy is a local radio station that is poisoning my local community. People ask why don't I block the aforementioned users, and the answer is because they are not hurting me. Everything that they are doing does nothing but make Energy look worse, make Evanov look like an even more pathetic radio group, and every last itch and twitch they do to try to upset me does nothing but empower me, inspire me, and give me more to work with. Our community has far too many people suffering from discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment, r\/bullying, r\/cyberbullying, transphobia, racism, stalking and so much more. I have the means and the mental health strength to absorb all of their hatred and ignorance and show it to people who are in positions to make change that it is happening, it is dangerous and it is deadly. I can not and will not be broken, and that is why I allow these users to continue to try to break me, because all they are doing is making this fire inside of me brighter, stronger, more fierce and ultimately more beautiful. I will not quit.\n\nSo, as I've mentioned, I would love to hear your feedback about what you think appropriate courses of action would be! Remember that I'm from r\/Canada, from Manitoba to be more specific, so if you have any feedback that is jurisdiction-specific that may be relevant to your consideration!\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this!

My parents tried to 'ease' my emotional pain by saying like: 'there are a lot of people with lots of problems, way worse than you've ever experienced.' and when I mentioned about this incident for the first time they were disgruntled like: 'Bullied?! Online?! How?!'. They couldn't make any sense of it and I understand. It was then, now is now.\n\nCyber bullying leaves emotional scars that are impossible to repair. I seriously considered k\\*lling myself numerous times, attempted twice. I don't trust humans. I'd really really like to make new friends, but I've learned to assume the worst in humans. No matter how nice, polite or good looking you are, I simply 'don't buy it'. Don't take it as an insult. I'm a human, too.\n\nLesson learned the hard way, doesn't mean I like the fact that I learned it the hard way. It hurts. It hurts to suffer in silence. But I'm glad that I found courage to post this.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I was cyber bullied before the term social media became more common place.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI apologize for possible errors, because English is not my native language. Thank you.","Score":6,"Total_comments":5}

Now everytime I go here, I see -86 Karma next to my name. It's sucks. I was basically brandished (ostracisized) cruelly on this site. If there was public hanging, the angry mob that rushed to hurt me would have probably killed me literally. That's why I HATE humans too sometimes! They can be some of the scummiest souls that ever existed! They think that just because they are safe and hiding behind a computer, tablet, or phone screen, that they can already become one of the WORST people you've ever encountered! It's like their conscience goes away when they log on and they don't feel the least bit guilty! At least they make it seem that way! \n\nThere's a website named Quora and I frequent that site and someone mentioned that mean people that are mean in general can come to the internet and give their worst.

Apologies for any formatting issues.*\n\nSo a bit of a backstory about myself: I (20F) am very much  a writer. I love to write stories, always have for as long as I can remember, but have written some poems for fun as well\u2014never really for the purpose of sharing, just for the fun of doing it. Writing stories is my go-to way of venting and also really helps if I'm stressed about something. So some time ago my aunt introduced me to a website called AllPoetry, which has kind of a \"sister site\" called StoryWrite.\n\nI submitted some stories to StoryWrite and some poems to AllPoetry for feedback. I got some really amazing comments on all of them and everything was fine for a while. About a month ago I commented on another writer's poem to give my input on their writing and suggested using a bit of punctuation to help the reading of it flow a little easier\u2014doesn't seem like much of a problem, right?\n\nA few hours later I received some really nasty words back from that person about my own poetry, which I wasn't initially upset about because it's their opinion as to whether they like it or not\u2014but then the person said some really mean things about my appearance and my profile picture on the site, which is me as a four-year-old. *(* ***I*** *think it's cute, but that's just me ;) )*\n\nI blocked this person shortly after receiving these messages, but when I filed a report with the site administration they informed me that they could not remove the person from the site or prevent access. I don't think it will happen, or can, but I still worry a bit about whether or not this person could somehow contact me some other way.\n\nThis is the poem they commented some negative things on the site about: [https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1m7tyTs\\_lwWAAXN17WrJl5DxGnq9m1FnIQy60xJ7O0To\/edit?usp=sharing](https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1m7tyTs_lwWAAXN17WrJl5DxGnq9m1FnIQy60xJ7O0To\/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nHere is a screenshot of the kind-of \"ending\" of the conversation that passed. You can see my profile picture next to the paragraphs. The second and fourth \"paragraphs\" are the other person and the first and third were written by my friend (the first is in my perspective, because I have extreme issues standing up for myself and was scared to write something myself, and the other is in her own words trying to defend me).\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/g1aytcug14j51.jpg?width=2176&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=43169c08b235c4695d1828d0b96d99537cffc939\n\nThe last line in particular really upset me to the point that I can't go onto the website anymore and can't even write anymore\u2014AT ALL\u2014because every time I open either my notes on my phone or a notebook I only think of that line and it just really puts me off doing it because I'm scared if I share something again it will happen again.\n\nAm I just being paranoid about nothing? Advice strongly appreciated, as well as some input on my work. (It might not help the situation, but it would really make me feel better about what I love to do)","Score":4,"Total_comments":1}

I joined Reddit a couple of days ago and apparently you have to wait a certainty amount of time until you can post. I think it\u2019s been a couple of days now so it might be ok. Anyways, regardless of weather you see this as spam, I hope at least one of you could possible relate or give some guidance.\n\nNow I have an Instagram account with around 170 followers where I post drawings of anthropomorphic animals. So with the stuff I draw, one would I assume that I am a furry. I am not. I have friends who are furries, I used some furry hashtags for my art but I don\u2019t identify as one. Of course this hasn\u2019t stopped people from calling me one, jokingly and derogatorily. I know you\u2019re thinking why Id get offended by this since I\u2019m not a furry. Well I guess I just hate being labeled as something I\u2019m not, and when your labeled as a part of the most hated group on the Internet, it\u2019s sort\u2019ve just gets to you. But until today, most of them were from random people I would only interact with once. The worst of those moments was someone telling me to kill myself because \u201cI was a furry\u201d in a comment chain. But what\u2019s happening to me now makes that event seem like nothing.\n\nThis morning, I wake to see I have 2 notifications from Instagram. One being a dm from a friend and the other from a q&a thing I posted to my story. Now for the questions, I didn\u2019t expect much. I mostly expected joke questions like, P E E N. There were 2 questions asked. One was a joke question and the other was asking if I was a furry or a zoophile. This really soured my mood. It was one thing to call me a furry but a ZOOPHILE!? I ended up blocking the person and tried moving on with my already soured day.\n\nLater some time around 2, I got a dm notification from Instagram from my second account. It was that same guy. He had actually sent me dm, telling me I was disgusting cause I was a furry and to seek help. And just like on my main, I blocked him with added bonuses of telling him to go f**k himself along with reporting him. I know I shouldn\u2019t acknowledge my attackers but I was feeling too emotionally and I wasn't thinking clearly. And I thought that would be it. It was over, right? Wrong.\n\nAbout an hour ago, I received a dm request from Instagram again. It didn\u2019t take me long to piece together that it was the same dude. The bastard made another account. He said how I should stop denying I\u2019m a furry, how I should be kept away from animals, and how drawing anthro animals is a fetish or something. But then he told me something I found scary. He said he had 5 other accounts and he would continue to harass me. I blocked, restricted and tired to report him but there was an error with Instagram.\n\nI am currently terrified. It\u2019s one thing to call me a furry in a comment section but to actually go after a person and make several accounts just to harass is me on another level.\n\nThis all feels surreal, like this has to be a dream and how this couldn\u2019t happen to me in real life. But it isn\u2019t a dream, and it\u2019s actually happening. He hasn\u2019t tried coming after me with another account yet, but I suspect he\u2019ll be back real soon.\n\nThere\u2019s something I didn\u2019t mention. I while back, a friend added me to a group chat. I\u2019m bringing this up because the guy who is attacking me is one of the people from that group chat (not the friend, but one of the members).\n\nI really don\u2019t know what to do at this point. I can\u2019t report him to the police since he lives in Cypress. Blocking is just a temporary solution because he\u2019ll continue to make more accounts. I tried reporting him for bullying and harassment but my report was rejected.\n\nIs there anyone who\u2019s been in this situation before? Does anyone have any solutions?","Score":3,"Total_comments":3}

I honestly thought he blocked me and was never going to speak to me again. I started talking to a new guy that week. Then, all of the sudden my ex sends me a message and says he had to check himself in somewhere for a week. I had no clue that\u2019s where he went. Anyways, later that day he sent me a message and basically told me he found out I was talking to someone new. And he was going to make me suffer for it. He had pictures of my in my underwear, and he planned on sending it to him and my family. He did end up sending the pictures to the guy I was talking to. He said he hopes we both suffer. After that he promised he deleted them. But then when I said I wanted to be done talking. He tells me he still has all the photos and he plans on keeping them to look at and to send to my family and friends. He\u2019s already threatened me and made me block the new guy I was talking to and never speak to him again. So... i dont know what to do at this point.","Score":3,"Total_comments":10}

Nothing happened but the intent was there. Now this person, found my long term partner, and has doxxed both of our names all over twitter. After telling this person on twitter, I do not want a relationship with them, they have now decided to take revenge and tell the story of our three dates on twitter. I fear my behavior, if found out, will destroy my dear partner. I deeply regret my behavior, but find this woman's doxxing rather extreme. This woman and I never even held hands, and she has contacted my girlfriend, and like I said, exposed her and my \"relationship (mind you this consists of three dates months apart with no physical contact\".\n\nIn short, I wonder, is there any way to stop this person from just airing what I consider our private dates\/interactions all over twitter? They have doxxed me and my girlfriend by name. They basically just have this thread of describing our dates which are quite harmless, but of course harmFUL when considered this is publicly being shared, which can find its way to my partner. They have contacted my partner, who blocked them, and are now spitefully spewing it for all to see in the ether of twitter.\n\nIt is sickening to me because of my guilt and I am so afraid my partner will find out these details if you will\n\n&#x200B;\n\n.

I started posting on Reddit a couple months ago due to my interest in a TV show. I haven\u2019t made very posts outside of the TV forum. I\u2019m generally polite and cordial to others, and was making posts because I\u2019m interested in hearing what others have to say about some of my ideas of the show. It shouldn\u2019t be a very controversial topic, yet I\u2019ve managed to attract some extreme daily toxicity. Not sure what I can do at this point other than just stopping to post these ideas, which appears to be what the bully wants as well.\n\nI\u2019m at a loss about what to do about this situation. Targeted harassment and release of personal information are against the written rules of Reddit. \u201cIt crosses the line\u201d they say, yet here we are with nothing be done about those rules being broken. I try not to let it affect my everyday life as best as I can, but sometimes it does, unfortunately. Because of that, I\u2019m considering just moving on, let the bully have his Reddit and I will look for another platform with more freedom to disseminate the ideas. \n\nIt might be helpful for me to hear from others and how they handled their situations. Maybe I did something wrong here like make a second account and respond to him and that\u2019s why Reddit won\u2019t help? Maybe Reddit agrees with bully that I\u2019m \u2018mentally ill\u2019, shouldn\u2019t be posting these ideas?

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"hjcdw5","Title":"Last night, I [F26], got blasted on social media with outrageous lies by a girl from my hometown that I\u2019ve even never met.","Author":"lifeisabeach4","Timestamp":1593617191000,"Text":"\nTried to post this 2 days ago (so keep in mind when referencing times \/ dates etc.) ... ,but it got removed. This is mainly a vent, but I could use some advice if you happen to have any. \nSo it\u2019s Sunday night, I\u2019m just minding my own business with some music, meal prepping for the week, and finishing my laundry. I get a message from a sweet girl I knew back in the day that recently moved to TX. She sends \u201cgirl.....\u201d then it says \u201csends attachment\u201d then I just wondered if you have seen this.  So I immediately thought it was some spam post. Until I find out it\u2019s not. She sends me a screenshot of some random girls Facebook post with me tagged in the first sentence. She claimed the most bogus stuff I\u2019ve ever read. It didn\u2019t even make sense to me. She said things like I stole her car the night before and moved it to some apartment in my hometown. I haven\u2019t been home since early June. She gave this very detailed horrific story and stated that I was going to get caught and that I did a lot of very insane things.  I was completely shocked.  This girl had 6,000 friends (on FB) all from my hometown. Had family members of mine, old teachers, people I go to church with, old coaches of mine, and even current coworkers of mine. I immediately tried to go to the post to comment or whatever (although I didn\u2019t even know where I would begin). Wells turns out she tagged me , then blocked me so I wouldn\u2019t see it or be able to respond. (The post was up for about 30 minutes until people started contacting me). 67 people reached out asking what this girls problem was. They stated things like \u201cwhat is this girl on\u201d \u201cyou? Out of all people\u201d \u201cOmg look at this insane person is saying about you\u201d (everyone that reached out didn\u2019t even assume it was true even for a second). Well I ended up going through my friends FB to comment back. I told her that the police station has no report on this (when she stated they were investigating the \u201ccase\u201d). I called the records department and they didn\u2019t have any report filed with her name or mine. They hadn\u2019t even had a report from the location within the last two weeks.  So I call her out on it and mention that I had enough problems on my own than to think about someone that I\u2019ve never met and do things to mess with her or anyone for that matter. I politely asked to keep me out of her drama and to post any supporting proof of this to explain why I out of all people was tagged in it and targeted. Her response was my phone number, my address and my parents addresses and screenshots of my tweets that were just me talking about a toothache and Xbox? I was currently telling everyone to report it through FB for harassment and they did, but it didn\u2019t do anything. \nA few hours I\u2019m receiving d e a t h threats from people texting me and telling me to watch my back and stating that they were going to literally \u201cbeat my head into a wall so hard that I would go blind, deaf, and then b l e e d to d e a t h within minutes\u201d literally said that word for word in one of them. \nI am still very blown away. I have no idea why someone I forgot even existed would target me and try to get everyone to hate me. It has been a pretty rough day. I had to file for a restraining order on her, her best friend that I have no idea who it is and there\u2019s a civil case going on for defamation. The detective on the case is also trying to get a warrant. The post was up for almost 20 hours. Everyone saw. And although tom not sure many believed it, it still makes me look like a terrible person. I live almost two hours away from these people. Everyone is saying my exes family hired her or it was my ex or that my ex and her are dating etc etc. (my ex and I broke up about a month ago). I don\u2019t think it was him, but none of it makes sense.  I\u2019m really trying hard to ignore it, but things like this that make me want to just d i e.  I have been doing so good with building my self up after this break up, but then I get hit with someone trying to ruin my reputation and threatening to k i l l me and posting our personal information online in a hate post. I am currently living alone and I\u2019m terrified to even walk to the mailbox.  Im leaving town.  I\u2019m going to go travel the country in my car and camp and turn my phone off the entire time.  I planned this anyway because I\u2019m actually having to quarantine from my work for 3 weeks due to a family member testing positive for having COVID\nLastly, I\u2019m also getting blackmailed. They say they have n u d e s of me. They say they have s e x tapes. They say they have private things of mine. \nI received more than 31 threats of harm. There are 3 officers watching my house from a 2 block radius. I just can\u2019t believe what\u2019s happening. No idea what\u2019s happening.  They are out looking for the girl to question her.  I never posted a statement on my page because I just didn\u2019t care enough.  I never post - why would some girl that does d r u g s make me post and share even more of the drama? No I didn\u2019t want any of it. I just ignored the replies. I ignored it all. I tried to brush it off. Everyone\u2019s telling me to deactivate my social media for a while, but how is that fair? What will that do? No. I don\u2019t care so much about the people that would believe something like that. The only thing that scares me is the threats I\u2019m receiving to hurt me physically. The officers stated they were confident the judge would issue a warrant in the morning, but I think that\u2019ll just make things worse. I don\u2019t know any explanation of why someone would do this.  I don\u2019t think my ex is behind it. I really want to believe that he has nothing to do with this. But at this point I\u2019m not sure what to believe. I\u2019m just hurt. I\u2019m tired of hurting. I never do anything because I\u2019m also pregnant. The girl mentioned that too which NO ONE KNOWS ABOUT. But I guess everyone does now. Or wonders it.  This isn\u2019t a way I wanted to tell people. I denied it for now. Why won\u2019t people just leave me alone? I just want to be alone. It\u2019s so much easier this way. I thought this and thought if I minded my own business then trouble and drama won\u2019t find me. Well I was wrong. I\u2019m hoping the police will get to the bottom of everything sooner than later. I\u2019m glad Facebook finally took the post down but I know at least 1,200 people that know me saw it. I also have proof of me being at a church function when some of this apparent accusation went on. I just wanted to post this.  It hurts holding it in.  I wish I had answers and explanations, but I guess I don\u2019t deserve anything like that I guess I\u2019m not enough of a person to deserve respect and to be treated like a human. No ones ever been able to recognize me as being a person so why did I think anybody would now? This hurts. It hurts bad.","Score":3,"Total_comments":2}

This happened over something in a private group chat, but you need more context to understand what's actually going on.\n\nMe and some other guy made a goal to try and get banned from as many \"gaming\" subs as possible (it was a joke from r\/BanVideoGames). This happened in a BVG reddit chat we made a while ago. Now, this person (the OP of [this post](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/iamapieceofshit\/comments\/hi610t\/these_two_have_taken_a_bvg_argument_too_far_by\/)) was in our chat as well. He was one of the people who either didn't understand BVG was satire, or knew it but went against the satire anyway. Anyway, this person had been trolling for a long time on r\/BanVideoGames and kept pretending to be these latios or latias characters that he keeps talking about. So we thought it would be funny to get banned from his subreddit about them.\n\nBasically, we asked in chat if we could get banned from his subreddit. He said no, and that no matter how many times we posted the \"latios is a hate symbol\" copypasta on his subreddit, he wouldn't ban us. He said he would just remove the posts and called it a \"minor inconvenience\" to do so anyway. Naturally, we knew there was a breaking point somewhere, so goblin (the other guy) made a copypasta and I setup a script to repost the copypasta every 15 minutes and left it running overnight. At some point 15 minutes was changed to 15 seconds, and it kinda derailed from there.\n\nSo, I do think this went a little too far and I apologize. In fairness, I didn't think he would be this upset by the bot, because he initially didn't seem to be bothered by it. We are sorting this out in the group chat right now. But I just think you'd want to understand the situation first.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

It's an amateur team but i wanted to join it so i can get into small fun tournaments etc.   \n\n\nBut, one of the guys is from Newcastle, and he has a bit cruel banter. I like silence and just dry humor, but i hate humor that make fun of others. They do it all the time in this discord server.   \n\n\nI am a bit introverted, i turned 21 last week but don't have a gf yet. I'm not really bothered about it, but when they make virgin jokes (They don't know i am a virgin) it makes me feel really shit.   \n\n\nBut the worst thing is, when they make the \"gay\" jokes. I don't understand how to respond to it. For example, the english guy will say to me something like \"Hey babe, we're married right?\" and i just don't know how to respond. I tried to just laugh it off and say something like \"No i'd rather not\", but then the other guy (He's from spain) says \"Just accept that you are gay\". I understand that they are all jokes, but i just wanna have fun in a community where i don't constantly have to defend myself and act all cool. It seems that just laughing it off doesn't work. If one of the guys says \"You've got no friends do you?\" i just don't know what to say, because i really don't have many friends. And i know that they probably just wanna joke around, but i've always tried to be wholesome and i've grown up to be kind to everyone, i've always had a hard time with jokes like this. People calling you gay, or saying you're lonely or a virgin, or ugly etc.   \n\n\nWhat is the best way to respond to things like this? If someone calls you a virgin or ugly, or just calls you gay out of nowhere as a joke, how do you respond? Or if someone says that you're his \"babe\". I know they are just jokes, but it's humor that i hate because it really puts someone on the spot. I'm into girls, but if i respond with \"No, i like girls\", it works in contradiction. If i just laugh it off and ignore it, they just keep going and i'm an easy target for jokes. If someone say's i have to friends, and i say \"How'd you know\" to try and be funny, they instantly reverse their joke and use my joke againts me.  \n\n\nIs it too much to ask, to just be nice and not having to defend yourself with humor all the time? Because i suck at humor, i take things way to seriously because i was raised to be kind and loving.","Score":5,"Total_comments":2}

The huge problem of violence is still unresolved. A man named Vladislav Pozdnyakov is an admin of the group \"The Male State\". The problem is that in this group he advocates violence, Nazism, nationalism. He calls for bullying of teenagers and women. Regular posts are sent with personal information of victims: links to accounts of parents, teachers. Even telephone numbers! Prozdnyakov works very simply: his followers find 10-year-old porn and start distributing it to everyone. Also Pozdnyakov publishes links to accounts of teenagers who are members of the LGBT+ community. A man calls on their parents and teachers to write about it!  \n Recently, he waited until the night to post another post. That night, a young woman who is teaching at the university was victimized. Porn with her was sent to her students without her consent! Me and the other girls fought a long time and tried to call her so she could close the account. It was mentioned on the news the next morning, but Pozdnyakov still feels impunity!  \nRussia is a backward country that does not protect the rights of its citizens. Pozdnyakov is still at liberty, probably left for Poland or Georgia. We\u2019re trying to find the right people to hold him accountable.   \n Being a mestizo, Pozdnyakov continues to humiliate other nations and fight for \"purity of blood\". We do not know how many lives he has already broken. He keeps making fun of us. He says he won\u2019t stop.  \nPeople are scared to live. People in the government support it on their Twitter accounts. It\u2019s terrible. We have no protection. But we can cover this topic not only in the Russian-speaking segment, but also in the English-speaking segment.  \nWe created a hashtag #\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0438\u0433\u0440\u043e\u043c\u043a\u043e (say it out loud) so the victims can report it!  \nPlease help disseminate this information, make replacements and retweets with posts with this hashtag!

It spreads over several platforms via the internet and it can transform any individual's psychological state to a horrible one, inducing them into self-harm and in even more extreme cases, committing suicide to escape from the pain and suffering.\n\nOur campaign was created to raise awareness of this overlooked issue and we wish to inform everyone, especially those of the youth about the effects of cyberbullying and how we can assist in reducing possible cases in the near future and to hopefully have the potency end this classification of bullying.\n\n\\#Don'tBeAFollower\n\n\\#MakeADifference\n\n\\#EndCyberBullying\n\n\\[ Note: this campaign was developed as part of an assessment for one of our university units and we are required to disseminate it across social media and engage as many individuals as we possibly can.

He tried to become my only friend (by spreading rumors, so others wouldn't like me) to leave me too so I wouldn't have friends at all.\n\nWhen I told him that I know what he is doing and that I don't want to be his friend anymore, he said that I have to do what he wants or he will destroy my life.

When everyone blocked him he started making livestreams and spending 99% of the time on insulting me.\n\nNow I gathered enough proof to actually do something about it and after publication of video some of his 'friends' started writing to me about how he really treated them so at least I know that I'm not only one.","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

Every time I see it occur I try reporting him but because its 4chan he gets away scot free most of the time (i reported him last month and they didn't delete a single one of his posts) and even if they ban him, its only for 3 days usually. He just doesn't learn. I talked to the admin of the archival site and requested to take down all the pics so they don't reappear in there, which he agreed to, but they still appear on normal 4chan. The worst thing about this is that it makes me feel like i'm being watched constantly, and when people call him annoying for posting those pics it harms me too because I don't want people thinking that's me. The earliest instance I could find in the archive of him doing this is late november, so its been going on for almost 5 months and he never seems to stop. What should i do? Force myself not to look at the archive so I don't let it bother me? I'm sick of being afraid every day and checking when he might do it next. Also they have a policy there where the images are owned by the poster, so I can't do a copyright claim, even if they're my pics.","Score":3,"Total_comments":12}

This is the closest idea I could come up with, because it kind of has to do with this. Basically, when i was 14-16 (I\u2019m now 18), I would go on these websites like Omegle. Just for fun, entertainment, I was lonely at school...stuff like that. Well basically, there were a bunch of older guys, from like 20 to ones in their 70s, who tried to get me to \u201cdate them\u201d, sent me pornographic images, harassed me online (like I mistakenly gave them my number-I was naive-and kept on getting called and had to keep on blocking them). I did many things I shouldn\u2019t have done. A lot of it was just because it was interesting and exciting, having that attention, and feeling valuable. I also wanted them to keep on talking to me. That\u2019s sad, but I was very lonely and had low self esteem at school.\n\nBasically, was what those guys did wrong or illegal?

It's an effect of social predisposition. It's an interesting phenomenon. Like if you lived in a society that was fine or even commending you, then you would feel the opposite. In fact most users who inherently don't feel any problem at the time or anything about it, end up feeling guilty or mad later on more because of social predisposition than the actual thing they're blaming for feeling bad.\n\nSo yes it's definitely not legal to even show anything sexually explicit to minors.

Not one where I was hit(although I've been there before) but one where I was constantly lied to about my ex partners intentions. My ex partner at the beginning of our relationship had expressed to me that they shared many of my interests. I found out that was false as the years went by. My ex partner had concocted quite the facade. At the time I met my ex partner I was still in the process of rediscovering myself after being in a very mentally\/emotionally\/sexually abusive relationship. I had not that many people in my life as a I was still recovering from the isolation and pretty much fell in love with the first person that had showed any ounce of kindness towards me. Anyway time went on he revealed himself to be a \"nice guy\"(ya know the kind that's only really nice to you because they want to pipe?) Well I ended up dating him because why not. We had highs(once he surprised me and took me to the zoo for our anniversary after I got kicked out) and lows but the lows were very low(in an unlucky week I got into two car accidents, neither we're my fault I called him and he literally replied with \"What are you calling me for?\"). I had a period of time after one of the very low lows where I began to have feelings for a mutual friend of ours I got hammered at a concert and gave him a peck then threw up and told my ex partner about it immediately. We decided to work on our relationship which really became me becoming his play thing for him and watching him play videogames for hours on end. Then we finally broke up. I was honestly relieved I was very unhappy with the relationship and what it had become. However our mutual friend had discussed having feelings for me a week before my ex partner and I broke up. I was not so keen on entertaining the idea of being romantically involved with our mutual friend because I did not want to hurt my ex partner. Then I checked his twitter. Everywhere I was branded a whore. On every social media platform: Instagram, snapchat, twitter. People in the community I live in stopped talking to me. He had spun this tale that I was constantly cheating on him with our mutual friend(the only thing that ever happened between our mutual friend and I was the one kiss where I told him about it immediately nothing else happened). I had people constantly questioning my integrity. I had people harassing me at my workplace. It was horrible and he would not stop on this rampage to destroy my public image. It had hurt quite a bit and it still stings that someone would do such a thing. I decided to delete my social media and live life do me and actually go on a date with our mutual friend which is now my boyfriend. They're not friends anymore after what happened and my true friends were revealed as they took me for who I am and not what someone posted about me online. \nNow that Im back on social media I get anxiety to post anything about myself at all.

Well, I\u2019ll start explaining the situation. \n\nThis happened a few months ago, one day during a exam my teacher took me aside and asked me if I was okay, and I was confused because nothing had happened to me, then he told me that someone had took my Facebook photos to a forum alike to Twitter (But a kinky one) and in the description they were asking for \u201cc*ck\u201d and \u201cc*m* tributes, there wasn\u2019t just pictures of my, there was also another girls in there, the majority from my semester, but I didn\u2019t give It importance and keep in doing my business. When I arrived to my home I search the forum and it was disgusting, I didn\u2019t knew what was all about when my teacher told me, but know that I had saw it I decided to do something, I told my parents and they call the cyber police but they didn\u2019t do anything, then I got together with some of the girls in the page and planned to take legal actions but at the end nothing happened. We were able to track the ip and it was from our school, the location was supposed to be encrypted so it was done for home one who knows a lot about computers, it also was supposed to be from a Mac and an iPhone but I\u2019m not really sure about that.\n\nThere\u2019s more details and I even have a suspect but I can\u2019t really do anything because I have no proofs and I could end up being in trouble. I didn\u2019t do the tracking by myself so I can\u2019t confirm anything, there\u2019s any form for me to find the person behind this? They recently uploaded a friend of mine and I think it needs to stop, this might be the person testing the waters, they could do something worse if we leave it alone.\n\nSo please, if you know how to find they please dm me.\n\nSorry for making this so long and thanks for taking the time for reading this :))","Score":3,"Total_comments":1}

I've had decent discussions in various TV show subs. However, if anybody has ever been to that sub, it's impossible to discuss that show. It's teaming with trolls who hate the show, and abuse anybody seeking to have a legitimate discussion about the show. Including mods of the sub with the same sort of abusive behavior.\n\nSo I was abused by a few users in that sub. One of them continued to follow me and harass me around Reddit. Including to various subs he has never posted in. But only in that sub to harass me. And often when they do that, they're not outwardly saying anything to in violation of that sub's rules. So that's how they try to get away with harassment. Since they have no life.\n\nI had reported him to Reddit admin at the time because of stalking me around Reddit. And he was temp banned. But they let him back on. Despite post history of pretty much all trolling and cyberbullying. He even made a hate sub specifically meant to troll that same TV show. However, nobody ever posted in it, but himself.\n\nI am posting this here to warn others.

The last 6 months of that time, he started dating someone.  He lied to both of us.\n\nI was falsely accused of stalking him a year after we broke up.  She used my letters to him while we were together as a basis for a restraining order.  Only thing I was guilty of was believing a \"friend\" of his.  They kept calling my new number to tell me he had a plan to have her dump him.  I didn't want him by then.  I had moved on and was starting a new life for myself.  They wanted me to send flowers to her so she would leave him for a secret admire.  I said no, but money was mailed to me.  Wish I had kept the note.  I did order them and that got me involved in this stalking crap.  \n\nAt the courthouse, his lies were brought to the surface.  She got so mad to find out he was seeing both of us.  I was happy to hear that at the time.  It served him right.\n\nTwelve years later his mom died.  Her and I were very close.  I sent a plant to his brother and sister-in-law.   I cared for them, not him or his now wife.  His wife wrote me an email thanking me for the plant.  \n\nShe kept contacting me about how miserable she was with him.  She wanted to befriend me.  I kept myself at a distance.  Even met for lunch once but it didn't feel right.  Turned out she hated her brother-in-law and sister-in-law and thought I had dirt.  I don't since they are wonderful people.\n\nOnce I served now use to her, she got nasty.  She has been attacking me on social media and online.

Somehow managed to meet a guy face to face after exchanging some contacts ( fb and phone numbers) that turned out to be a bully. Disclamer: I had a few requests that week that I had approved in a single shot in the evening. \n\nI agreed to meet with him ( I was aware he was a bit impulsive and impatient) but managed to carry out a conversation and analyze him during our talk. His demeanor was off putting since he was kinda negative and entitled to himself. At the end of the date , out of nowhere he started to bring up something about me blocking his friends that were also on the website... The talk escalated into accusations and blaming... I kept it under control , not wanting to make the alarm go off and kept cool...(those red flags got me thinking the guy was sent on a mission)\n\nPost date he messaged me wanted to know if he fit the mold , what I thought of him, etc. I replied with something like ; 'you're ok but we don't match' , send him off and wished him good luck finding another, blocked him, since I had no interest in continuing or being a laughing stock for his group of friends I said NO to him.\n\nMy surprise came two weeks later , received a call thinking it was related to a relative being hospitalized but was wrong. He called again , from a different phone number, he asked me on a date again  , I said no ... he brought up the blocking issue again , etc. I heard another guy's voice and knew he put the call on speaker, he wasn't alone. At that point I felt like my integrity and privacy was violated and my decisions were nothing in the face of this person that I consider a bully.\n\nAs a conclusion I am taking a few measures: unchecked fb friend request options, will change my phone number and limit my online activity for a while.\n\nI wrote this post because I had to get it off my chest, I know this might be a minor case compared to others but we have to take action and stand by our decisions so NO means NO\n\n&#x200B;\n\nP.S.

But she wouldn\u2019t tell me, so after much convincing as well as ice-cream I got her to go to sleep.\nAnd as the smart person, I am I recorded everything she did on my iPad in case something like this happened, as I watched the recording I was bewildered at what these kids say.\n\nThey were saying stuff like she was worthless and that she was an ugly nerd and a pig and some censured cursing. And doing some wired stuff even I was confused at.\nLike what's the purpose of typing slap or kick like what was that supposed to do? But none the least it was hurtful.\n\nIn the end, they said it was a prank for YT, but even so, it was unacceptable to say such things, like you don't know what the other person is going through and saying something like this could do a good amount of damage to there self-esteem, I hope no one ever does this again.","Score":2,"Total_comments":1}

There were rules against bullying and bad behavior in general, and also that members should keep the conversations friendly for younger people (which would give off false sense of safe community), but they were more like \"pretty words which made the community look nice\" the truth is breaking them never resulted in bans, warnings or any forms of punishment. I was a fool to stay, but I didn't want to be driven off by few jerks. I was the person who was often kind and perhaps too friendly for my own good, but I got mad easily and refused to kiss up the one jerk who openly insulted me. She and few others bullied me from the beginning and ganged up to offensively silence me if I ever wanted to be heard in the community. One time I got mad and called them out directly, then left the place once and for all. Some members of the community followed me to other social media and continued bullying there with alternative accounts. The insults were still drawn back to what happened in the community however. \n\nFew quiet bystanders from the community noticed my distress and reached out to help. or so I thought, I barely cared if their attempts to help were genuine... They pretended to be friends as long as they could physically assault me. But if I squealed to anyone, especially law enforcement, they'd frame me of the assault - because I dared to defend myself instead of becoming a total martyr. I couldn't do much after that.\n\nIt's been years since then and the community is broken, but these people have become very influential on social media and now sometimes even dare to campaign against bullying and acting manipulative on the internet. A hopeful person could see they might've changed, but considering how they treated me, I think they are acting this out of being two-faced. Because the community was almost exposed for what it really was, which would mean them being exposed too! A rumor goes they are re-connecting with each other on twitter and have planned something mean for the \"old people\" (meaning those they bullied?) on some discord private chat, but I can't prove if it's true. Which is why law enforcement can't be arsed to do anything and I don't know if a common person like myself could do anything to make their lives harder to prevent them from making mine harder. I'm low on money also, because in my country there's shortage on jobs, so I can't just hire some hacker and expect them to do the job for me - might as well lose it for nothing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIs there anything I can do to help myself?","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

Instagram will do nothing to mitigate despite me and many of my friends reporting her. Is there anything I can do?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHey fellas, I'm a fashion photographer and my ex (a model\/actress) posted loads of photos defaming me saying I used my photography to lure women into bed and that she is one of them, even though we were in a serious relationship for 2 years and I didn't shoot with her until we started dating. Other times she posted my photos saying that I'm a perv and that I use women (without specifying how). She is well connected with many models in my area and even reached out to almost all of the girls that I follow on Instagram, including many I have shot with and told them that I cheated on her (which I didn't) in order to rally them against me. She even teamed up with another bitter ex of mine to contact these girls and rally a cyberbullying team of almost 10 other people to reach out to girls and companies I work with to ruin my career.\n\nIn response, I asked my friends to report her defamatory posts but Instagram says none of them violate their guidelines, probably because they are too vague to be considered proper slander. I eventually gave up and just blocked her, but 5 months later her posts still remain and her following increasing exponentially, so I still feel the effects today. I find it hard to find work or models to shoot with. As a result, I had to switch to corporate photography\/video and move away from her city, even though fashion is my passion and I loved that city.\n\nTo be completely transparent, I broke up with her because she was physically and mentally abusive\/manipulative. I was always loyal to her, and even sacrificed many friendships to keep her emotions at bay. Tbh, I was afraid of breaking up with her because I was afraid she would act out like this, or worse (she did almost kill herself). I've always held a professional reputation in photography, and would never disrespect women. Part of the reason this infuriates me so much is because it belittles the actual abuse that some women experience and makes it harder for people to trust those who were truly violated.\n\nI'm not sure what to do address this, or if it even can be addressed. Thanks for hearing me out, and I welcome any advice.","Score":2,"Total_comments":4}

One such character I found interesting, though I do not condone his actions at all, was Lemongrab of Adventure Time. I had drawn some art of him paired up with another outcast, but changed his character a bit so he wasn't a psychopathic mental case since he would be a protagonist. \n\nNow, my interactions with clubs and their admins had been positive and professional up to this point, where I decided, just because it was a Lemongrab club and was one of the first results on a group search, I would submit a pic to LEMONNATION. Boy, was that a mistake. Not only was my submission rejected, but I got a nasty note saying that this group was only for a particular ship. I replied with a simple, \"you don't have to be so rude about it\" and got another nasty reply. On top of that, the ringleader of this ship posted a nasty comment on my fanfic journal saying things like my OC was a \"mary sue piece of garbage\" and tried to pass this off to her friends as \"constructive criticism\". What reality does she live in? \n\nAll the while, she had made a rant journal about me making fetish art of \"her\" character. News flash! Lemongrab doesn't belong to you, ass clown! She said I said I was a professional, and her friends called me a \"pretentious twat\" behind my back. I made a status post expressing my anger about her antics, and I got nasty comments on my homepage from her friends about how I was \"toxic to the community\" and other such hate. I tried not to let it get to me and just made anti-Lemonsids (their ship) stamps, because, honestly, if  these people are such jerks, why shouldn't I hate on their ship? All the while, they tried to play it off like she was the victim and that I was the one \"harassing\" her, when the opposite was true!\n\nShe tried to play the \"you can't fight back against me, I have special needs\" card, but I didn't buy it because A) I have special needs, too (I just don't advertise it because I want to be treated as an individual, not a disability) and B) Even if you are special needs, that doesn't excuse being a complete asshole  to a random person you've never even met, but you antagonize because you don't like how they draw a character that doesn't even belong to you!\n\nThis went on for a week, dA admins were no help, even tho I reported what was going on, my BF tried to reason with the girl behind all this, but she just flamed him with walls of text and sent me a message from an alt account about how I was \"disgusting\" and he was a \"white knight\". Unbelievable. It got so bad that I couldn't eat cuz I didn't wanna cry about it. I should've cried. I really should've cried. Crying is a healthy outlet for your feelings. \n\nEventually, I tried reaching out to others on dA, but some stalker friend of the Lemonsids girl said that they \"had evidence against me\" and I was \"a horrible person\". Again, they're the ones who are horrible. I took down the stamps and apologized for making them just to get these people to stop. And they did. But, the ringleader still has her rant journal about me in stash \"just in case\". The worst part was none of my watchers or friends wanted to get involved and I felt so alone against these people. The lies, the mobbing, Lemonsids shippers are the real horrible people. And from what I've been told, the main girl yells at 12 year olds. Such an angel.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

story I'm a 21 and a female and I still live with my parents anyways one day back in 2017 I was talking to one of my friends and he shown me a video that someone was making fun of my friend well I went to the person's video so I told the person in an angry and cussing way why the f\u2664\u25c7\u25a0 are you exposing my friend and some other random dude and he went crazy on me and I got a notification from that random dude from that video and the random dude would not stop pestering me threw the hang out app it was non-stop calls and texting I couldn't relax or work in peace or watch videos in peace or play video games he should have understand I have a life and I know he needed my help on reporting the video making exposing guy but it got ridiculous and really old really fast but anyways the video making exposing guy even got his friend involved and made a video on me and then they started to threatened to dox me which is a form of hacking that involves of exposing personal information on the internet and it's illegal and you go to jail for it but anyways they actually did they threatened me to throw me in jail or threatened to kill me or worse I was very scared and very sad and very angry I wanted to protect myself and my safety but they lived in other places such as the northern hemisphere of America even the video making exposing guy was saying inappropriate stuff to me I was on the verge of exploding into fit of exstream rage let's put it that way anyways I had to stop this guy several times on the internet but it cost me for some more exposing videos he would do on it was out right horrific and he manipulate one of my friends into hating me and I had to get another friend to straighten him out and then the video making exposing guy found so pictures of me on and he called me fat and ugly it literally torn me apart and really lowered myself esteem and he started accusing me of something that I've never done in my life and I don't have the part's for it either and he threatened me to called my boss and my parents basically it was the last straw that broke the camel's back I deleted everything from YouTube to Twitter and Google+ and I cried for a whole 2 days non-stop to relieve a lot stress and pressure and the beginning of a spiral downward depression well this story ain't over yet 5 months later I was on my favorite YouTuber's channel watching a live then this person started some crap on the live stream and I got really angry and told him to fricken stop and load and behold he put my information on where I live well I realized it was that same video making exposing guy and every time I watched my favorite YouTuber the video making exposing guy would come back to make accounts impersonating me or harassing me and they would banned him but he would come back and sometimes they thought I did it but no it was that stupid video making exposing guy impersonating me they would put me in time out for 300 seconds or 5 seconds and also he almost broke my friendship with my favorite YouTuber it was ridiculous and then one day the random dude found me again on the hang out app so I started telling him \"I not helping you anymore with your problem with video making exposing guy\" \"Oh yeah you are going to help me\" and I said \"I'm deleting my accounts like it or not\" and he said \"no your not your going to stay here and fight and suffer the pain and consequences and I'm going to go to bed so talk to you tomorrow good night\" well what I did I deleted all of my accounts that night anyways I hope video making exposing guy messes with the wrong type of person and he gets his a\u25a0\u25cf sitting behind bars in prison for a good amount of years in prison dealing with the big boys in prison or getting sued the heck out of or worse and for the random dude to make himself understand that people that have lives and somewhere to be like me so that is the end of my story \n\n\nUpdate: one of my friends found me on ps4 a few months ago and we got to talking about what happened and why I disappeared and I told him \"I left because I was tired of video making exposing harassing me and not to mention I went into a spiraling depression and extreme territory because of video making exposing guy and not to mention I couldn't handle it any more I told him it ruined my sanity to and not to mention the guy ruined my life to because I can't work anymore because I'm on SSI due to frequent melt downs at work and being to slow and letting the old memories of what happened to me bother me so much\" and he said \"the guy ruined my life to because of the same bull s\u2661\u25c7\u2661 he did I just can't be happy anymore and my sanity is ruined to\" and I asked him this \"How did that kid started bothering you and your friends\" and he said \"one of my friends got hacked by video making exposing guy because he wants to make everyone on the internet so miserable that the video making exposing guy dies by they're own hands\" and I was in ear shot of what my friend said and I said \"damn that guy needs to be in prison for life for trying to kill people like that\" and he said \"well squids he's too young to go to prison he was 13\" and I said \"I don't care there's juvinal detention it is a prison for kids who did such horrible things or boot camp and that's military camp for bad kids and soldiers in training\" and he sat there in silence and he said \"you're right why I didn't even think about that and by the way I banned him from the internet\" and I was like \"Really that's good by the way  how did you banned him\" and he said \"Well we took videos on the guy and emailed it to the head honchos of YouTube and Twitter\" and I said \"that's great I'm glad they saw it and I'm glad they throw his a\u2606\u2606 off the internet and that point on forwards I was happy the video making exposing guy was banned for the internet that's the end of my update good bye for

Despite being subjected to the \u201cnonsense in the air\u201d on facebook and other platforms, including physical media and press meetings, Karoor Soman(\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d42\u0d7c \u0d38\u0d4b\u0d2e\u0d7b) continued writing without fear knowing very well the truth. This story also tries to explain how online abusers, liars and harassers work to abuse, defame, menace, insult, injure using social media platforms that can have an detrimental effect in real life as it promotes suffering and humiliation.\n\nWe will also look how the cyberbullies\/blackmailers will spread misleading and inaccurate information to artificially exaggerate the claims, with the sole intention to degrade and shame writer, Karoor Soman(\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d42\u0d7c \u0d38\u0d4b\u0d2e\u0d7b). I will be also looking to show how organised hate is used in this day and age. The internet platforms and other media news outlets are used by these cyberbully liars to harass, bully, intimidate and cause real life harm on the writers reputation and writing, all in the name of freedom of expression. Let\u2019s start our journey.\n\nKaroor Soman(\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d42\u0d7c \u0d38\u0d4b\u0d2e\u0d7b), author and writer of more than 40 books was startled to hear from his friend that a blogger of \u201chuge reputation\u201d had posted a facebook video rant against Karoor Soman(\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d42\u0d7c \u0d38\u0d4b\u0d2e\u0d7b) and one of his books. He is familiar and well experienced to know that in the literary field, there will be critics and opponents. Karoor Soman(\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d42\u0d7c \u0d38\u0d4b\u0d2e\u0d7b) viewed them from the context of purely literary criticism and never took such things personally. So it was surprising for him when he was notified that his name \u201cKaroor Soman(\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d42\u0d7c \u0d38\u0d4b\u0d2e\u0d7b)\u201d was mentioned and allegations of copyright infringement was laid. Knowing very well that there are have been jealous people of questionable repute who have always loathed him; he assumed this to be false and aimed at tarnishing his name.\n\nIt was reported by fake media that Karoor Soman(\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d42\u0d7c \u0d38\u0d4b\u0d2e\u0d7b) supposedly said about this matter directly in a facebook post. \u00a0In all fairness, if Karoor Soman(\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d42\u0d7c \u0d38\u0d4b\u0d2e\u0d7b) had said anything during that time of an unrelated matter linking social media and abuse, these cyberbullying liars\u2019 aka online abusers (politically correct term- \u201ccritics\u201d) would twist that truth. Today\u2019s social media is used negatively and if it was within a reasonable person\u2019s to respond to it, it is not surprising. Majority of the time, all online abusers and followers have no idea of the complete picture of what\u2019s happening and are quick to make judgements. Some of them have ulterior motives based on revenge, some based on money, and for some others-pure fun of wrecking and disorder. The book in question was an informative book that was published in India and Karoor Soman (\u0d15\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d42\u0d7c \u0d38\u0d4b\u0d2e\u0d7b) was the author of this book.

Their methods and techniques are revealed with the example of  a case study. Hopefully this will inform and safeguard both adults and children in the online world.*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nhttps:\/\/preview.redd.it\/yz43oxm1l1p21.jpg?width=771&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85a9103f119e27e6b03fd425fb83f9c261f6ff75\n\nFirstly, happy and secure people don\u2019t need to bully. This article will not look at the plain cyberbully who barks out nonsense for the sake of it but at the educated cyberbullies who defy reason and logic to entertain themselves from their pathetic lives. I hope this small article is of benefit to both kids and adults alike in our socially connected worlds where cyberbullying is allowed and is flourishing.\n\nTo identify genuine cyberbullying is relatively simple -: look for patterns of behaviour that is demeaning and deliberate towards the victim frequently. Ugly trolls of today are crooked, lying losers who genuinely have little substance going on in their life, so involve themselves in such acts. Make no mistake, they will do everything to mock and alienate you from others.\n\nConsistent harassment is one sign of spotting a cyberbully; which in the initial phases would involve some sort of financial arrangement.  There is always a financial arrangement with such people. Always! Greed is a huge driving force and should not be underestimated. These ugly \\*\\*\\*\\* crooked cyberbullies tend to do charity with the blackmailing extortion fees from the victim. Pun intended.\n\nBlackmailing is standard for such people. There will be some hypocrites who wail about \u201cOh! I am doing a social good\u201d nonsense. Separate the chaff from the wheat. If it is genuine, they would not victimise and neither harm. They would find out, sort out, work out, and find a better solution than cyberbullying. If the victim does not play according to the blackmailer\u2019s demands, the blackmailer turns from playing blackmail to playing full mode cyberbully.\n\nAnother trait to look out for among these new breed of cyberbullies is what I call the term \u201cmoral cyberbully\u201d. The cyberbully usually would use an excuse\/circumstance\/situation to enhance one\u2019s own feeling of moral superiority to do the trolling and cyberbullying. They display primitive response\/reaction of hate and jealousy. Please note there is no cure for jealousy. No matter what reason or debate is thrown at them, they cannot view past their own little brain of hate, revenge and spite. They would make excuses so that they can keep hating.\n\nPersonal revenge motives also play a huge factor with such idiots. These crooked liars pretend to fight for truth and justice. This is one of the best indications that you are dealing with a real douchebag whose main purpose is attention seeking or to become famous and \u201cfight for a cause\u201d. Look out for these types as they tend to drown on their ideas for a long time.\n\n**Advice**: Ignore such people and get on with your life.

The teenage mind is it\u2019s worst enemy because it is only half development. The brain develops at different levels but obviously the body and brain begin a drastic level of change at puberty. The process of these higher functions start at the back and moves its way forward over many years to the frontal and prefrontal cortices where aspects like empathy and impulse control develop. \n\nA lack of impulse control means not knowing when to put your phone down, stop teasing someone, (or from the bullied individuals perspective: stop engaging with the bully.) I think this is why people seem perplexed when I suggest that you just block someone who is being an asshole. Because their impulse is to fight back or retort and it\u2019s very easy to do those things online if you can\u2019t or won\u2019t do them in person because our technology removes the interface of our physical reality and our bodies. We know someone will not physically harm us so it\u2019s easier to be mean. It\u2019s also easier to fight back because there is no external threat. \n\nI doubt it would help, but perhaps if along with trying to alleviate the problems that lead a kid to bully another kid, (even though it\u2019s the parents responsibility) anti-bullying nonprofits should promote information on the adolescent brain and how to better regulate behavior. It could help alleviate that desire to engage in a conversation of harassment.\n\nAs far as the actual social component, all we can do is stop kids from hurting others when it\u2019s made known to us. Kids will always be assholes. But to willingly engage with someone online who is harassing you is your choice you have to own and whatever comes of that is a factor you chose to engage in. This doesn\u2019t excuse a bully or bullying but rather serves as an opportunity for self-realization and empowerment. Hey being an adult means having to own up to your responsibilities for your own health and happiness to SOME degree as long as you are a somewhat formed conscious human being.

I came here because my niece is getting older and I want to understand online bullying should I need to council her. I am ignorant about the issue and people have been kind enough to share their experiences. Ive learned it is difficult dealing with online bullies for a multitude of reasons and I\u2019m thankful for those who shares their experiences. If I sound like I\u2019m preaching it is just because I hate that people get bullied and I only want to help in the only way I know how: which is simply sharing my experiences. I wish everyone could just walk away and ignore their bullies but I know now that it is not that easy for everyone. It is not possible for everyone to do that. I do not have all the answers and I never claimed to. So I apologize if my dialogue seemed uncivil and overly opinionated. I appreciate your opinion on this matter.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I give you a advice: to survive the internet, it is better to overcome the trolls by being the troll (because that's what all these illogical downvoting misconcepted people are, trolls) and to stand your ground, despite the down vote. It is true that Reddit is big, and surely you will find people who do recognize logic, moral and truth. He will understand you. In no means I say you have to bully them back. That's a toxic troll.

I wanted to find people who could inform me about things I didn't know about and about things I hadn't experienced. I had recently gone through quite a great deal of grief trying to get a low radiation Ct scan after having a year of scary on and off palpitations..chest pains..left arm pain and episodes of near syncope..I ended up getting admitted tot he hospital cardiology ward (by real doctors) after real red flag test results. After being told to get some tests that would add to my already unfavorable radiation exposure at a younger age I checked out of the hospital undiagnosed (which was scary) I then fought first to get a MRI (which I utterly failed at) then was railroaded intot eh lesser damaging of two tests without which most cardiologists wouldn't see me.. Due to previous symptoms of a reaction I had which was explained to me by 100 percent of people as a iodine reaction I went ahead with a test with a premed called prednisone which I was informed would be safe to take at the massive dose they gave me (it wasn't) I was assured not to take any beta blockers and all would be handled at the hospital. When I got tot eh hospital long story short  my heart rate sky went way high and I was given about ten minutes for beta blockers to fix me..They said everything was ok and took a scan which I later found out was done at a still high heart rate and which yielded (fair quality) Noone cared to explain this to me so I posted on a radiology forum in detail like this and was cruelly trolled by a radiologist moderator who decided in his infinite genius that I was not allowed to post a question only answerable by raiologists in a radiology forum..I later posted something making conversation and surprisingly he left the post up? Do you know why he left it up? He found something in my post which was meant to ask questions (which he didn't answer) and to provoke a discussion..he lefOft it up so he and his cruel hateful and EXTREMELY rude and foul mouthed bunch of radiology friends could try to discredit me..Obviously my very serious question about image quality left nothing for him to attack so why allow me to get my question answered that I lose sleep over....of course his friends and him wasted no time finding one thing to attack knowing nothing about what my actual real life situation was..so they could jump on the over radiated and not surely diagnosed patient who dare speak out against the danger of radiation and the desire to prevent future allergic reactions of which I was living proof exist because I suffered with them..Like a pack of hungry wolves they jumped all over any chance they could find to discredit me with a total disregard for the post really at all...Then they got the girl I was supposed to be going on a date with to read it and trash me for it on Christmas Eve..Bottom line the world is full of ego tripping trolls and sometimes they are the ones supposed to be in charge of preventing them!\n\nP.S. if you want to see the post it might still be up but they changed the heading from radiology forum to DENSE AF...","Score":1,"Total_comments":4}

We just assumed that she may have been in our school before and gave her the benefit of the doubt . Little did we know , it was our worst mistake.\n\nTen days ago , he\/she sent a short explicit message to me , I didnt respond and Fake just unsent it . I freaked out and blocked her , and didnt think much of it , since no one would believe me (my big mistake) .\n\nJust on Christmas Day , the class leader posted a story on how Fake is catfishing people from our school and making fake sensitive pictures (referred to as SPs) out of their normal pictures (boys) , while asking us to block\/report her . When this came to our attention , most people did block and report her . But my idiot of a classmate sent this story to her asking if this is true . This set her off .\n\n This brings us to her main target , let's call him Mark . She stole Mark's identity on Instagram and already made fake SPs of 3 of his friends and started threatening him (in his DM) by saying she will post them unless he sends his pics as well . He shared the DMs with us in a secluded friends group . This went on long enough to the point she declared she already posted one of his friend's pictures somewhere on the internet . I got pissed and cursed her in her DM , but she didn't respond and blocked me (now I am a target) . My friend also did the same , but she responded saying she dosen't care and that Mark ruined his friend's life (and then also blocked him and may also target him) . Her account was soon taken down for harassment\/bullying .\n\nIn the meantime , Mark told us that she gave her number to one of his friends and that she wasn't that smart (confirmed) . We managed to track that number to Tamil Nadu , India . As our school is primarily Indian we can see why she would be interested in our school . If the number was really hers , then this wasn't good because we live in the UAE and if she is from India it will be harder to report this to the police . And just so you know it , India isn't up to date with cyberbullying laws .\n\nYesterday , She made another account and tried to talk to Mark again but her weird way of speaking in messages gave her away and he reported and blocked her before she could threaten him . She keeps coming back again and again , that too in different social media apps like Facebook , to harass us . We can't even entirely ignore her either , as she already has fake SPs of 3 boys , which could well ruin their lives .\n\nAs this point , me and my best friend made fake accounts to keep an eye on her while we were protecting our original accounts . She won't leave us easily .\n\nHere is what we know about Fake : \n- She is catfishing 9th graders from our school\n- She is trying to get pictures of boys and make fake nudes out of them\n- She is targeting Mark's friend group and our friend group , with Mark as the main target\n- She lives in India and knows we live in another country\n- In all of her fake accounts ,she always kept the same way of talking\n- She has taken the fake sensitive pictures of 3 boys hostage\n- We don't know if she is targeting girls as well , but we haven't heard anything from girls yet .\n\nPlease help . We are just waiting for this to be over , but Fake won't budge and is harassing us . And even if she leaves us , she might use our pictures to catfish other people .\n\nTl;dr Cyberbully from India catfished and made sensitive pictures of 9th grade boys from our school (maybe even posted one of them) , and is actively targeting one student . Everytime her fake accounts are shut down , she comes back all the time . Need help to get rid of her .\n\nIf there are forums to crosspost this for more help , please let me know . Any help will be appreciated .\n","Score":5,"Total_comments":2}

This means you can recognize the impact this has and that you want to change, so I commend you in doing that. I know it is not easy to do at all, now I am not going to say all addiction is the same because it is not, but methods can be used across many forms of addiciton. I am drug addict 7 years clean and have worked in facilities where a few clients did suffer gaming addiction.\n\nIn moving forward keep an open mind, I am not saying you have to follow a specific method, but I advise you give everything an honest effort and try. There are support groups online, and some 12 step groups. If your area does not have gaming or gambling feel free to attend NA or AA. Just listen to the concepts if you tell people there you're there for gaming and this is the only support you can find people will be happy to help you. The main thing is having support, someone to talk to when you're in a tough spot. I feel that gaming addiction is more overlooked I dont see as much groups tailored to gaming but gambling is known to be a good match if you dont have gaming support groups.\n\nNow what I would really want you to think about is why do you choose Supercell or games as your escape. Better yet how do you feel when you're playing, is it an escape? Does it feel like it centers you? These questions may help determin some of the underlined issues that drive to this addiction. I have never seen a case of addiction without some sort of mental illness or trauma. When I say trauma I dont mean the extreme things we think about it can come in different sizes. It could be moving to a new town as a kid, parents divorce, bullying, rejection like a break up with a SO or friend. Now you may feel (I know I did) that wow that cause me trauma I must be weak. That is not the case it simply means you did not process, cope, and come to terms with it. There is usual multiple underlined issues so it takes work, reach out to a therapist. I came from a family that did not believe in it and if you go you're crazy. Just know many people who go to therapy have no diagnosis they simply may be going through a tough time or even just seek some guidance.\n\nHope some of this helps and I wish you well.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

I wish, looking back on it, that I had screenshotted it for proof. It got so bad that I just deleted all of my videos and my account altogether. This has also happened in my sixth grade year, when I was twelve-ish, on a website called Quotev. I'm very upset and I thought that part of my life was over. I don't know what I did to deserve this, but I know I don't need it.

I would get Verbal abused here and there by teammates and then through text chat by the enemy team. While this may be hard for others, I found that the best solution to this is to change the way you view different things. Take a  break from the game for a while(Could be a day to weeks, even months) and when you come back play just for the enjoyment of the game. When you lose, don't think negative thoughts about \"I played garbage\/Bad Deck\" but rather instead what you can do next time to beat the enemy?(Class royale I'm assuming). If the enemy trashes on you, don't take it to seriously. How you take criticism and trash talks are part of what defines your personal character. Ignore them and move on, and I'm sure you'll be able to not get too angry on games\n\nLike Sprucay said earlier, there's a high chance that Supercell isn't targeting you. Supercell runs a lot of popular mobile games, and to actively assist potentially thousands of people an hour with a small team would surely be difficult to the point where they would rely on automated text messages. It is also likely that they may have a detector for swear words, so keep the words clean on reports.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

The game is Dawn of Titans from Natural Motion. \n\nHere is how the cycle works, a group of players start taking lands from others waiting for a public complaint. Once that happens they remove half your lands while mocking you in chat. If you strike back you are doomed because you are forced to remain in the clan for 24 hours and during it they can reduce your lands by 1\/2 every 5 hours as the shielding for land loss is useless due to the 24 hour forced stay.\n\nI watched about 15 people run out of the game by the bullies and the company did absolutely nothing to the abusive players!!! Why is that? Because those same players spend a ton of money basically buying their immunity! \n\nNatural motion in their quest to make money are in fact helping to create and protect cyber bullies!\n\nIf they were out to protect the victims they would penalize the bullies or at least increase the shield times for land loss to 24 hours and trigger it by 2 lands lost not 50%!\n\nThey could also disable a players ability to attack for excessive land grabbing and\/or targeting a player. \n\nThese money grubbing companies should be held liable in a few class action suits and maybe they might put the victims first! Instead the bullies will rule until a firm connection between gaming cyber bullying and violence from our teens in the real world is made!\n\nIt will then be the legal responsibility of the company to protect their players!","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

What can I get in trouble for?","Author":"throwaway13444499955","Timestamp":1522685840000,"Text":"So kind of a long story here.\n\nYesterday, on April 1st, I made a huge mistake. \n\nThere was this girl that used to go to my school who threw a big party yesterday. There were many Snapchat posts of this online and I screenshotted two of them. As an April Fools joke, I cropped herself out of the two pictures, stacked them on top of each other and added a caption \"when you finally throw a party that somehow isn't even corrupt\" or something like that.\n\nMy intentions were not to bully her in any way and in a sense, I praised her by calling her party not corrupt. The word \"corrupt\" in this sense comes from an event that she ran in school where many individuals were arbitrarily selected and even though candidates like myself went above and beyond the cutoff application expectations, we were not selected. This led to further issues like making public group chats with selected members and calling me several names behind my back. She forced people not to talk to me and block me online, sending people to intimidate and blackmail me in the hopes that I don't expose her corruption. This all happened in November. \n\nEventually, the entire school found out about her event's corruption and I did complain to the school administration. 2 months later when I asked the school staff about the situation, the girl in question left the school long ago, and they said that they dealt with the situation in its entirety, but are under no obligation to state the consequences. \n\nPersonally, I feel as if the situation had not even been touched as several members were involved, there had been no story of students getting suspended or even investigated for that matter. However, everyone in the school knows that I reported the event. There were about 40 students involved in this situation altogether so I doubt it would be even feasible to deal with in the first place, which is why I don't think it was solved in any way. However, after reporting her event's corruption, the people that bullied and harassed me seemed to have stopped, which was the good thing that came out of all this.\n\nAnyways, apparently, after I posted the picture of her with the aforementioned caption, an hour later I get a text message from one of her friends saying that she wants the post deleted. I asked why but still deleted the post immediately nonetheless. Furthermore, I apologized to the girl that the photo was posted of via direct message and told her friend that I apologized as well, which she conveyed. I apologized several times and her friend told me that the girl just said \"I don't care\".\n\nHOWEVER, she told her friend that she already called the police yesterday night and she is going with her father to speak to them in person about this issue. Her parents are lawyers and I doubt she even really cared about the post getting deleted or my apology. I personally think she just wants to ruin my life because I exposed her past corruption, and she jumped at the first opportunity that she had. \n\nApparently, in the place where I live in, there have been incidents of police brutality and excessive force which is what I'm really worried about. In terms of getting in trouble, I just reposted something that was already online (doesn't every Internet meme do exactly the same thing?) So can I really get in trouble for something like that??? My intentions weren't to bully and I praised her for having a party that wasn't corrupt. As soon as I found out she had a problem with the picture, it was deleted. \n\nAccording to her friend, the only thing she cares about is the photo that I posted and she thinks it's photoshopped but it really isn't. She will not respond to me personally because she hates me and according to her friend, it is not advised to speak to someone that you have legal problems with.\n\nI am slightly worried about this and am wondering if there is anything I can get in trouble for or pressed charges for. And in the event that I do get in trouble, I have a 50 page document outlining almost every single thing wrong and corrupt in the school event that she ran earlier. The caption was in reference to that event, so this information should be relevant.\n\nThank you for reading through all this and I hope that I can obtain a sensible answer.","Score":2,"Total_comments":1}

I've dealt with a male stalker in the past who sent me really disturbing images to my house and learned at the time not to engage and not to interact, because even telling the person \"Stop it! Don't contact me!\" is 'encouragement'. This time, it's another male who I don't know if what he does qualifies as stalking. Mostly, this bullying has consisted of harassing emails and tweets shaming me. \n\nLately however he's started to \"go public\" by spreading all kinds of falsehoods about me. Here's the tricky thing. Part of me really blames myself for not telling him to F off like a year ago. My problem is that he's 1) mentally unhinged but one of those high-IQ people who comes across as respectable if you don't know him that well 2) potentially physically a threat. He came into my workspace and screamed and banged things around. On the one hand I want to stand up to a bully. On the other hand, I want to not be physically attacked. I called the police but they are very passive about this, saying ,well, he's probably not going to hurt you, he's not a known criminal. \n\nI hold no grudges toward him despite the fact that he's made my life hell and genuinely wish he will win a $20 million lottery and enjoy his life, forget about me. But he won't let go. I dunno if it's because I've been so non-responsive (I've heard it takes two to tango, and have literally not replied to any of his messages in 2-3 years), or because I'm a woman, or whatever. It seems like whatever I do, whether I leave him alone or actually get in touch with him to ask him to stop, his main goal is to keep tormenting me. I've barely interacted with him, but he's become obsessed.\n\nSome advice would be helpful. Stand up for myself? Or, simply avoid contact like most experts advise?

I don't feel there should be any shame in admitting that you got cyber-bullied, no matter what age you are. \n\nI say it was recent, but this happened on-and-off spanning the last two years, so it was going on for a while. It's still not over, because the pain lingers, and the ways for the bullies to access me remains, and I know, that this experience will stay with me for life, and the paranoia and worry that they will get through to me and hurt me again somehow will stick.\n\nI live quite a sheltered, introverted life offline - I only really ever hang out with my husband and his family, and my family rarely. So, I took to the Internet to try and gain more friends, after years of feeling lonely online but too shy to start up conversation.\n\nI eventually gained a few, but with my open heart and my naive mind, I thought their intentions were naturally good. I thought everything would be sunshine and rainbows forever because my offline friendships throughout my life had been pleasant and although they came and went, I was never the target for malice.\n\nBut online... I don't know if it's the online environment or just the temperaments of those I befriended that can make people act like total dicks, but regardless, I quickly ended up on the receiving end of all kinds of psychological abuse. I don't know if to others it looked like I had the word \"TARGET\" stamped across my forehead but whenever there was a problem, I was the verbal punching bag.\n\nThere were in total 8 (out of the 10) people that treated me this way.\n\nRumours were made about me\n\nI was called vulgar swear words, c*nt was a favourite\n\nIf I spoke up when something wasn't right, I was told to stop it\n\nI was called teasing names that they laughed off and found \"cute\"\n\nThey told me that they covered my photos in cutouts of others to mock me\n\nI was controlled\n\nEmotionally manipulated\n\nIf I was comfortable enough to be fully myself or bubbly one day, I was told I was attention seeking\n\n1 person in particular enjoyed having full control over opinions, actions, and the whole setup became a dictatorship. She was as calculating as you can get.\n\nI was told that my offline life wasn't true (I made up my partner, etc)\n\nWhen I tried to leave, I was stalked\/my activity was checked up on\n\nThere is a term in abuse called \"crazymaking\", and that describes quite succinctly what I experienced as a whole. It was a 'You are wrong, we are right, even if how we are makes no sense to you, you must believe it makes sense or be ridiculed and ganged up on for it' kinda thing.\n\nThere was so much more, but I think that shows a good enough picture.\n\nThe big question for many seems to be \"Why did you stay with them for so long? Why did you not just click the X?\"\n\nWell, in my case, I am extremely loyal and hopeful by nature and that hope for better, and for acceptance, left me in a bad situation for far too long.\n\nThere were two people who weren't part of the bullying. One wasn't around most of the time... but the other became my best friend, and left them with me.\n\nWe both moved on and found a new loving circle of friends who build us up AND let us talk about\/get over the shit that happened to us. For my friend, the thing they did to her was think she was a spy. It's pretty laughable, looking back, but the pain remains, the memory is stuck in my head like a scar and every day the cruel words said to me bounce around in my brain over and over.\n\nWhen I trusted these people, I gave them offline information that I cannot now take back. They have it. I worry about that.\n \nI am safer online now; I teach myself what you teach kids about online safety, and no longer think that because I am an adult I am above it.\n\n\nNo matter who you are or what your age is, cyber bullying stays with you. The pain lingers, but that's nothing compared to the memory that will always be there. Then there are the parts of your life that you let the people access when you still trusted them. Those ways to get through to you will remain open. You let yourself be vulnerable, sharing stories about your life and past that you would tell any close friend, but now you see that the 'close friend' part was an illusion, your personal details are in dangerous hands and could be shared with others in any way they please.\n\nYou're always on edge, because even if you dont hear anything for months, any day they can get at you again, whenever they feel like it. And blocking? It only goes so far. If they can't get straight to you, you can bet they will get around. In most cases you can't expect your new friends to block your old ones.\n\nCyber bullying is psychological abuse and the effects are serious and long-lasting.\n\nBe kind, and treat people the way you would like to be treated. That's all I can ask and hope for. \n\nConsider your fellow peers.\n\nIf you don't get on? Just walk away.","Score":6,"Total_comments":4}

So I decided to try here. Sorry if this is the wrong place. Also I'm 18 and these bullies are around 15-17.\n\nSo a little over 6 months ago I was randomly added to a groupchat on Facebook Messenger which I ignored and forgot to leave thinking that they will just kick me out after a while (this happens to people in my school a lot).\n\nA month later the groupchat had a group video call incoming. At this point I knew one of the girls in the group was someone rude so I tried to just hang up and leave the groupchat. But I accidentally accepted the video call, didn't realise that I accepted until it was too late and ended up having about four-five people laugh at me. I hung up and felt too ashamed about it to tell my friends. I'm not that attractive, I'm into weird stuff and I'm kinda gullible so I know why I'm an easy target. I'm also really bad with putting names to faces so I only know one of the people's names and her gender but not what she looks like because I hung up too fast (plus I have a visual impairment so even if I did get a good look at her I couldn't use that information effectively).\n\nSince then I noticed them mock me for my looks in the hallways at school which I brushed off most of the time but now it's starting to get to me.\n\nThe situation on Facebook Messenger remained a secret in my head until a month ago when one of my friends told me that they turned my face into a snapchat sticker and are sending it around to everyone. They also went through my Facebook and started posting photos of me from 2012 on Snapchat and Facebook. I wouldn't have known this if it wasn't for my friend since I don't have Snapchat (I find it annoying after using it for a few months) and I unadded that one girl who's name I knew to reduce bullying. At this point I feel really upset about the situation and don't know what to do. Even now it's really affecting me negatively. Now I'm too ashamed to get into photos and removed all the mirrors from my room.\n\nSo two of my best friends have evidence of the sticker along with the names of everyone who is involved but only one of them know the full story with the groupchat. Should I get this information off my friends and tell someone? Should I rejoin Snapchat so I can stay up to date? Should I find some more information from other sources? \n\nI can't do anything in school about it since I'm finished for the year but I want to get this cleared up before my school's formal (basically prom in the UK) since more photos will be taken and I don't want to feel like rubbish during it. I'll also be in our school musical which is another golden opportunity for them to be mean.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

Bullies by nature are nothing new to our culture, although their methods in recent years have become far more frightening. In my day, I had my bullies too. But the worst you had to worry about was a fist fight at the bus stop or maybe getting your lunch money taken. Today's tactics however, are much more despicable. \n   I was born at the end of the 60's and grew up in a large city, in what would be considered by most as a bad area of town. I too was bullied as a youth and picked on for nothing more than my skin color at times. I remember running home, crying because some boy from the neighborhood was chasing me. But what I remember most is the reaction I received from my parents for such cowardliness.\n   I was instructed to go back outside and face my fears. To take that bully head on and that if I didn't I would face their wrath. Let me tell you I was way more afraid of my parents then I was that snot nose punk from around the way. \n   That's the difference between today's youth and the youth of my day, fear. My generation was the last one to be raised with any kind of structure or discipline. We had chores and were required to get good grades and we did. Why? Because we feared facing our parents if we didn't. Respect was never an option, it was required. \n   The catalyst to all of this was a decision made by one of our most beloved presidents, Ronald Reagan. While I don't like to speak ill of the dead, I think we have to call a spade a spade here. By taking away parents rights to discipline their children he effectively opened Pandora's box. \n   In the twenty seven years since he left office we have seen nothing but a steady decline in morality and an increase in atrocities. Millions of households are ran by the children as parents have no control. In my day you never would have heard of an eight year old committing suicide. And honestly I think we should question how a child that young would even know what suicide is. \n   But let's get down to brass tax here. If a finger is to be pointed here it's at legislation that was short sighted and far outdated at best. To restore order among these little hoodlums we need to become proactive. Reinstate parents rights to discipline and reinstate that fear factor.\n   As a child the only rights I had were the ones I was permitted by my parents. Children were to be seen and not heard. My opinion as a child and even as a teen counted for nothing. I was given clear direction and stiff consequences for straying from that path. \n   The children of today all seem to share the same sense of entitlement, where as we taught a work ethic to acquire the things we wanted. A disrespectful child now, receives a timeout and a stern talking to. I would of found myself picking my ass up off the floor. \n   So, how do we stop more children from dying at the hands of bullies? The answer is simple really. Take the bull by the horns. Make their choices, your  way or the damn belt. Make your children fear you, and yes I know how bad that sounds. But trust me look throughout history and you will see it too. Dictators have lived by the philosophy for years. Respect is better generated by fear than it is love.

Any time I mention them (no names and I often don't use the reddit name of their sub), they post long horrible posts about how the whole situation was my fault from ever joining a collab and expecting it to work like all collabs, to not expecting a rules change from them, to even being blamed on not being psychic and forseeing the other person causing trouble (which they claim wasn't trouble at all).\n\n\nThey go on LONG tirades about how it was all my fault what they did (they made hours long posts about how they never agreed moderators should moderate or how they have no idea why a collaboration group is expected to collaborate in the slightest was some sort of failure on my part as a human being and not something every collaboration group--especially professional ones-- like all others on  Reddit, discord, and other forums are supposed to operate) andey've threatened me over just mentioning them.  They said they'd 'take action' against speaking out and they said 'adults don't do that' (in regards to warning anyone else or asking if another writing group held the same moderator policies).  Anyone with half a brain would know asking if a group was like these people or a warning like those in beermoney wouldn't call that harassment.  That's like when Google got a bad rap for saying 'we don't want censorship, just no comments or records'. \n\nI know practically no one's here, but if anyone reads this, thank you.\n\nEdit: one of them made a throwaway account that's extremely obvious that keeps replying to this thread despite being blocked.

{"Type":"Post","Post_id":"5cpg9h","Title":"My cyberbullying story","Author":"pg62114","Timestamp":1479033814000,"Text":"So some time ago my little sister started telling me someone kept trying to hack her accounts. I wasn't too concerned and figured stuff like this just happens with people in college and it blows over, advised her to amp up her passwords and be careful who's on her friends list, and forgot about it. Last week she deactivated everything, I asked and it took some prodding before she told me the full story. \nMy sister had attended jr high with this kid, lets call him N. N and my sister were just friends, 0 relationship prospects, no chemistry, just friends type of friends. Years passed and my sister was fb friends with N who is 22 and now has a 17 y\/o girlfriend, we'll call her A. So A is a little crazy. Actually she's a lot crazy. Anytime A gets suspicious of N she assumes he's cheating on her and goes and tries to terrorize that girl by hacking her accounts and random drama queen actions. This time that person was my sister. \nA, the crazy girl, used her bf's account to leave comments on my sister's pics calling her a slut and other horrible names. She created a fake insta of my sister. Then she hacked my sister's account on some other social media, opened a chat with A's bf and wrote random crazy crap like oh I'm pregnant with your kids bla bla bla, took screenshots of this, then used these screenshots to threaten my sis that she would send them to family and friends and my sister's fiance. I know this is all made up because my sis and N are not even in the same country and have not been for months, and my sister and I share a bathroom (and hence a bathroom trash can where I can see proof of her monthly woman friend).\nWe come from a conservative background, things like this are pretty terrifying for reputations for us. So my sister who already has anxiety starts regressing. In just a few days her blood pressure dropped to 90\/50, she got fevers, woke up in the middle of the night with her heart racing, it was terrible to watch. \nTo make it worse, her friend N said he can't do anything to help her because it'll cause a fight between him and A and he can't have that. Jerk.\nI decided I needed to do something. I found N and A and their facebooks and from there found A's parents and aunts and grandparents, and I assume A is not openly allowed to date N because I found two facebooks for A and on the second one she had no family but all her lovey dovey posts with N. \nI try not to be a bad person. Sorry if I disappoint you here, I really wanted to ruin her life and do some horrible things to her, but she's a kid and I didn't want to make the situation worse for my sister either. I fb messaged who I thought was A's mother and two of A's aunts and said in the message that \"I have something to discuss with you about A, don't be alarmed or anything, but it is an urgent matter.\"\nA couple of days pass and my sister's old friend N messages me saying let's talk. I talk to N and he's respectful enough he doesn't want this to go further because it would make things bad for him and A if A's relatives started learning about their relationship. I assure him I don't plan on telling A's relatives about them if noone blackmails or bullies my sister further. To make sure to drive the point home I said my sister isn't scared we've discussed this with our family and her fiance so she's covered, but pushing forward on this feud would result in bad talk about all parties involved. \nThings were fine and then crazy A gets on her bf's account. I call her to discuss and guys this chick is PSYCHOTIC like I think she needs a psychiatrist she's first angry and offended that I messaged her relatives. I explained that I didn't say anything to them and I don't plan to I just needed a way to end this feud and the blackmailing. Then she's like \"if I wanted I could use your sister's screenshots to ruin her life by sending them to this person that person doing this and doing that and details of how she'd like to ruin my sister's life followed by 'but you can see I didn't so how dare you contact my family?!\" I was just like, omfg, wth, what kind of psycho, dear Lord give me patience with the devil, ugh, vomit. So I calm loca A down and assure her we won't do anything to her if she doesn't try anything with us and so we all promise to leave each other the heck alone and everyone blocks everyone.\nIt was the middle of the night so I go to wake my sis and tell her and she's so relieved she hugs me and thanks me and since then she hasn't had those symptoms.\nThis whole thing left me uneasy and with a bad taste in my mouth though. Like yes, I have stuff on that girl that would make her life difficult but in good conscience I would never use it. How do I know that this is over? \nToday my sister's insta was acting funny again she updated the password, Idk if it was attempted hacking again or just one of those things where you mess up the password yourself. I have told my sister to delete a chunk of fb friends until its less than 400 and to get rid of insta followers because you just can't trust 2000 people like this. \nInput?

At least forty five states passed laws against digital harassment.[105] Dardenne Prairie of Springfield, Missouri, passed a city ordinance making online harassment a misdemeanor. The city of St. Charles, Missouri has passed a similar ordinance. Missouri is among other states where lawmakers are pursuing state legislation, with a task forces expected to have \"cyberbullying\" laws drafted and implemented.[106] In June, 2008, Rep. Linda Sanchez (D-Calif.) and Rep. Kenny Hulshof (R-Mo.) proposed a federal law that would criminalize acts of cyberbullying.[107]\n\n>Lawmakers are seeking to address cyberbullying with new legislation because there's currently no specific law on the books that deals with it. A fairly new federal cyberstalking law might address such acts, according to Parry Aftab, but no one has been prosecuted under it yet. The proposed federal law would make it illegal to use electronic means to \"coerce, intimidate, harass or cause other substantial emotional distress.\"\n\n>In August 2008, the California state legislature passed one of the first laws in the country to deal directly with cyberbullying. The legislation, Assembly Bill 86 2008,[108] gives school administrators the authority to discipline students for bullying others offline or online.[109] This law took effect, January 1, 2009.[110] A law in New York's Albany County that criminalized cyberbullying was recently struck down as unconstitutional by the New York Court of Appeals in People v. Marquan M.\n\n\n\nThis is a quote from Wikipedia on cyberbullying...I hope it helps.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}

For 5+ years, it's been on \/r\/php where I was pretty active until cyberbullies basically forced me out. In September 2012, it got so crazy the admins acted, by banning my account from that subreddit. I actually thanked them for it, as I no longer felt like I absolutely had to keep defending myself, because I largely couldn't. \n\nBut to this day, cowards without anything to lose post the most horrible, slanderous things about me on that subreddit. The admins just tell me to suck it up, or leave myself, which I don't think is a rational policy.\n\nI know the issue is bigger than reddit, but other sites, like Google, StackExchange and Facebook, have in fact dealt with them, and I fastiduously create a new nickname on every other of the few sites I'm a member of, always cognizant that these guys will google around until they find everywhere I'm at to start attacking me.\n\nThis has been going on for 13 years, like I said, with ebbs and flows. Sometimes they are able to recruit mobs (almost always from reddit) when I post something that garners a lot of attention ([2009](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/politics\/comments\/9yek3\/im_27_have_a_rare_condition_that_is_100_treatable\/) and [2010](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/WTF\/comments\/e8mn2\/son_dies_in_the_park_cops_cover_it_up_an_unknown\/)), to personally attack me and people associated with me, calling our homes, offices, etc. Just plain scary stuff.\n\nHow come people like to side with the outright aggressors and penalize me? That's what I don't get. I also don't understand what is fueling 13 years of this except a seriously twisted person(s). \n\nIn 2009, after I had posted source code to a targeted project for the first time in 2 years, one of them contacted me via email within 20 minutes to berate it. I exclaimed, HOW did you know I posted code to a private server within 20 minutes?! and (s)he said that they were a member of Total Information Awareness, that a team of Europeans shared the same nickname and were basically paid to attack me. I've never forgotten that. I guess it makes as much sense as anything.\n\nI do know that these individuals have RSS feeds of my various accounts on the web or something, because they can and have attacked within minutes of posts, even after weeks and months of me being inactive.

I'll post the link towards the bottom of this.\n\nIt has to do with effects of cyberbullying on a legitimate user's comment karma. Cyberbullies operating in tandem, give minus points to their victim's comments. Meanwhile they give one another plus points for their abusive comments towards their victims. An example would be me creating a thread for friendly discussion in a section I have never posted in before. Then, getting over 90 minus comment karma points from cyberbullies trolling me there.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Cyberbully Characteristics**\n\nOne myth is that cyberbullies outright call names, and act verbally abusive. Not the case. Many of them use more subtle insidious invalidation techniques. It's a major form of emotional abuse.\n\nAnother one is that they know each other, and work together intentionally going around harassing people. Not the case. Many times, they are just random individuals who might not know each other. A few might start trolling\/harassing somebody, other random users begin chiming in to partake in the harassment. It becomes group harassment on an individual. Cyberbullying at its finest.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Continued Harassment**\n\nIn my case, cyberbullies continued to follow me into other Reddit topics for the sole purpose of harassing me. I mentioned the thread in which got over 90 minus karma from cyberbullies there. OK that thread was deleted. Four of the cyberbullies from that thread followed me into a different thread for the sole purpose of harassing me.\n\nThis is what somebody said about it:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n*\"Of course they were going to show up in the new thread, you were calling them trolls.\"*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nBasically, I call them trolls in a thread where they are completely doing nothing there other than trolling\/harassing\/cyberbullying me. That gives four users the right to follow me into other threads\/topics for the sole purpose of harassing me? Sure I probably shouldn\u2019t have responded to them. Does that give them the right to follow me in order to continue the harassing\/cyberbullying on me?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n**Helping Victims\/Targets**\n\nI think it would be good if we could help victims\/targets of harassment\/cyberbullying. I'm willing to help anybody report cyberbullying and harassment.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThey won't leave me alone. When the four of them followed me into the new thread to harass me, that's when I stopped responding to them. They continued to try to make comments in order to get a response from me. But I didn't respond to any of their garbage.\n\nSince then, I've been messaged by some. Meanwhile, one of them still continued to follow me into yet more threads. And he's completely insane. He doesn't post anywhere other than the Guild Wars subreddit. Yet he went into sections he has never ever posted anything in. Only for no other reason than to continue to harass me.","Score":0,"Total_comments":7}

OP wants to completely silence people that argue or otherwise hurt his feelings and thinks that he is entitled to that. \n\nEither OP is still in Highschool or needs have bigger issues to worry about.\n\nAnd yes I do agree that cyberbullying is an issue, but if everyone followed OP's preconceived notion of \"cyber bullying\" then all discussions would die and debates would cease to exist. Reddit would turn into \/r\/funny and \/r\/AdviceAnimals","Score":2,"Total_comments":0}

I mean, just look at [the third comment down](https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/user\/2c2bt) on his profile. The really long one. It won't show up if you go to the thread because the thread was removed by moderators for inciting drama, but you can see how he categorizes things like a madman.","Score":1,"Total_comments":0}
